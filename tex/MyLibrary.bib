Despite the importance of trust as a social and psychological concept, the concept has not gained much attention from evolutionary game theorists. In this letter, an N-player trust-based social dilemma game is introduced. While the theory shows that a society with no untrustworthy individuals would yield maximum wealth to both the society as a whole and the individuals in the long run, evolutionary dynamics show this ideal situation is reached only in a special case when the initial population contains no untrustworthy individuals. When the initial population consists of even the slightest number of untrustworthy individuals, the society converges to zero trusters, with many untrustworthy individuals. The promotion of trust is an uneasy task, despite the fact that a combination of trusters and trustworthy trustees is the most rational and optimal social state. This letter presents the game and results of replicator dynamics in a hope that researchers in evolutionary games see opportunities in filling this critical gap in the literature. \textcopyright{} 2015 IEEE.},

Experimental studies have investigated the resolution of such conflicts using public goods games with either continuous or step-level payoff functions. Game theory and social interdependence theory identify consequential differences between these two types of games. Continuous function games are prime examples of social dilemmas because they always contain a conflict between individual and collective interests, whereas step-level games can be construed as social coordination games. Step-level games often provide opportunities for coordinated solutions that benefit both the collective and the individuals. For this and other reasons, the authors conclude that one cannot safely generalize results obtained from step-level to continuous-form games (or vice versa). Finally, the authors identify specific characteristics of the payoff function in public goods games that conceptually mark the transition from a pure dilemma to a coordination problem nested within a dilemma. \textcopyright{} 2010 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of reputation has been extensively studied in economics, game theory in particular. The game theoretic framework for analysing reputation is that of repeated games in which some players are uncertain about the payoff structures of their opponents. There are two keyterms in this informal definition: repeated game and uncertainty. Both of them are well in accordance with informal understanding of the notion of reputation. The necessity of repetition is rather obvious it makes sense to build reputation only if it can influence future returns. If all interactions are one time deals then reputation is not needed because no one will happen to know in the future what you did in the past. Uncertainty is just a little bit less obvious: one who is locked into specific type of behavior, without any other options to choose from, cannot have reputation for that specific type. Rather, he or she is of that type with certainty. In this text we present how game theory operationalizes this informal view on reputation and discuss how the developed models can be applied in open electronic communities to promote trustworthy behavior. Sections 2 and 3 lay out the ground for understanding complex reputation models by descibing basic game-theoretic concepts including games with incomplete information and repeated games. Section 4 introduces game-theoretic reputation models on the example of the well known chain-store game, while Section 5 presents generalizations of the observations made on this example. These two sections deal with so called models with perfect monitoring in which the players are fully informed about the past plays of their opponents. Sections 6 and 7 discuss more recently developed models in which the players observe only imperfect signals of the past play. In Section 6 the signals are public, common for all players, while Section 7 deals with the case of privately observed, different, signals. We conclude in Section 8 with a discussion on possible ways to apply this game-theoretic modeling on online settings.},

However, to obtain these data, companies depend on peoples' willingness to share (WTS) their private data with them. By means of a large-scale online experiment with more than 20,000 participants, we investigated the extent to which peoples' WTS private data is affected by contextual factors. We complement and extend previous research by (i) simultaneously addressing several contextual factors that companies can largely control themselves, (ii) comparing their relative impacts on WTS, and (iii) explicitly examining interactions between these contextual factors in addition to their specific univariate effects. Concretely, we investigate contextual factors, such as the type of data requested, the purpose for which the data are used, the industry sector a corresponding company belongs to, the type of compensation offered for the shared data, and the degree to which the data allows for personal identification. Our data suggest that all these factors do affect peoples' WTS significantly, while there are also multiple significant interaction effects between these contextual factors. For instance, we found that a better intuitive match between the core business a company is engaged in and the type of data that is requested, results in higher proportions of people who are willing to share the corresponding data with the corresponding company. Hence, companies may benefit from tuning their requests for consumer or customer data according to the specific context in which they operate.},

We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance and detract from individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences.

Models of self-control problems and immediate gratification offer more realistic descriptions of the decision process and are more consistent with currently available data. In particular, we show why individuals who may genuinely want to protect their privacy might not do so because of psychological distortions well documented in the behavioral literature; we show that these distortions may affect not only 'na\"ive' individuals but also 'sophisticated' ones; and we prove that this may occur also when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their privacy as significant.},

However, we also document how prohibitively difficult it is to attain desired, or even desirable, levels of privacy through individual action alone. The remaining instrument for privacy protection is policy intervention.

  abstract = {In recent years, the increasing use of health information technologies (HITs) in support of healthcare services in developing countries has raised concerns about the privacy of digitized personal health information (PHI). However, there is little understanding of these concerns and their impact on individuals' PHI disclosure behaviours. This study seeks to improve current understanding of the factors that influence the willingness of individuals in developing countries to disclose their PHI to receive care where the disclosed PHI is digitized. To pursue this objective, this study proposes and tests a model of antecedents to PHI privacy concerns, trust in HIT, and PHI disclosure. Drawing on the procedural and interactional dimensions of justice theory and prior research it is proposed that individuals' characteristics, experiences, and perceptions form PHI privacy concerns and trust in HIT. Drawing on the privacy calculus, key factors that drive and inhibit individuals' PHI disclosure are also examined.    This study was conducted using a quantitative research design. The proposed model was tested using data collected from a survey of 276 individuals in Ghana, a Sub-Saharan African country. The data was analysed using the partial least squares approach to structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).    The findings of the study show trust in HIT directly influence PHI disclosure and fully mediates the influence of trust in healthcare providers. Convenience and computer experience also drive PHI disclosure. Trust in HIT is further shaped by privacy risk, government regulation, computer experience, and health concern. Perceived attitude of health workers affects trust in HIT through trust in healthcare providers.    Regarding inhibitors of PHI disclosure, individuals' perceptions of the negative consequences that may result from the exposure of their disclosed PHI decrease their willingness to disclose PHI. The results further show that individuals' concerns about the collection of their PHI differ from concerns about the management of the collected and electronically stored PHI. For example, individuals' express lower PHI collection concerns but greater concerns about PHI management. The results showed that PHI collection concerns decrease PHI disclosure whereas PHI management concerns increase PHI disclosure. PHI management concerns are shaped by computer experience, privacy orientation and trust in healthcare, with trust in healthcare providers mediating the influence of government regulation and perceived attitude of health workers on PHI management concerns. On the other hand, privacy risk, age, gender, and health concern form PHI collection concerns. The results also show past experience of privacy violation has different effects on PHI collection and PHI management concerns, increasing collection concerns but decreasing the management concerns.    Overall, the findings of the study provide insights into the drivers and inhibitors of PHI disclosure, the dimensions of PHI privacy concerns and their antecedents, as well as the antecedents to trust in HIT. These findings provide useful contributions to the IS privacy literature and actionable insights for healthcare stakeholders especially in developing countries, as they leverage HITs in the provision of healthcare services.},

According to this perspective, people's attitudes follow spontaneously and consistently from beliefs accessible in memory and then guide corresponding behavior. The number and types of beliefs that are accessible vary with motivation and ability to process attitude-relevant information and with the context. Based on these considerations, it is shown that the reasoned action perspective is compatible with evidence for automatic processes in the activation of attitudes and behavior, and with the finding that attitudes can vary with the context in which they are expressed. Implications for the attitude-behavior relation and for the role of habit in human behavior are discussed.},

  abstract = {A proposed theory of planned behavior, an extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's (1980, Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior. Englewood-Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall) theory of reasoned action, was tested in two experiments. The extended theory incorporates perceived control over behavioral achievement as a determinant of intention (Version 1) as well as behavior (Version 2). In Experiment 1, college students' attendance of class lectures was recorded over a 6-week period; in Experiment 2, the behavioral goal was getting an ``A'' in a course. Attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions were assessed halfway through the period of observation in the first experiment, and at two points in time in the second experiment. The results were evaluated by means of hierarchical regression analyses. As expected, the theory of planned behavior permitted more accurate prediction of intentions and goal attainment than did the theory of reasoned action. In both experiments, perceived behavioral control added significantly to the prediction of intentions. Its contribution to the prediction of behavior was significant in the second wave of Experiment 2, at which time the students' perceptions of behavioral control had become quite accurate. Contrary to expectations, there was little evidence for interactions between perceived behavioral control and the theory's other independent variables.},

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

Based on a 15-year data set collected from the Web of Science database, our paper seeks to provide a pervasive science plot of the intellectual structure of the SE field.

The study primarily adopted the research methodology of a systematic literature review, in which relevant and contemporary scientific literature related to the topic were identified and included, and irrelevant papers or those with repetitive information, were excluded. An analysis of the literature indicates that the common public perception of blockchain is positive overall. However, there is a substantial difference between public perception and reality in relation to the maturity of the technology. Proponents of blockchain often overlook and minimise the possibility of the damage that blockchain adoption could cause. This study found that main problem is not blockchain itself, but the surrounding infrastructure which has to be transformed at the same pace and direction. Furthermore, concerning identity management, it was found that the technology provides considerable improvement over database-based systems of identity and user authentication, however, it still contains systemic avenues of centralisation, through which a denial-of-service attack could increase. \textcopyright{} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {The rapid digital transformations across every industry sector, accelerated partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased organizations' use of information systems for operational and strategic purposes. These organizational responses have led to a confluence of digital, biological, and physical technologies that are revolutionizing business practices and workflows. But accompanying the pervasive use of digital technologies and the evolutionary nature of digital assets, is a shifting world of cyberattacks and information security (ISec) cybercrimes. Dynamic cybercrimes make it increasingly difficult for managers and researchers to anticipate the types, magnitude, and severity of future information security (ISec) breaches. Thus, we perform a systematic literature review (SLR) that explores, gathers, and categorizes event studies to examine the influence of favorable and unfavorable ISec events on stock markets. We extend the research conducted by Spanos and Angelis (2016) and provide a comprehensive understanding of the market's efficiency to process public information released about ISec events, ISec contingency factors, and the influence of ISec events on stock prices and factors other than price. Our systematic search reveals 58 relevant papers that include 80 studies. We find that in 75\% of the studies ISec events can significantly affect a company's stock market performance, and that such effects are primarily exhibited within two days before and after the event day. Further, the magnitude of abnormal returns is higher in studies examining unfavorable ISec events, such as ISec breaches, compared to abnormal returns from favorable events, such as ISec investments and ISec certifications. In the end, our SLR serves as a foundation for ISec and management communities to build upon to keep industry and academia apprised of continually developing trends, new attack vectors and types of data breaches, protective ISec behaviors and programs, and their subsequent influences on stock market values and returns.},

A game theoretic model is developed to quantify community effects and other factors in trust decisions. The model captures factors such as peer pressure and personality traits.

In addition, synchronous and asynchronous update algorithms are shown to converge to the Nash equilibrium solution.

We use two contemporary developments in science to illustrate our reasoning: First, researchers' willingness to engage with the lay public (e.g., investing one's limited time to public engagement) and second, their commitment to `open science' (e.g., sharing one's data and materials despite the risk of exploitation). \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Normative beliefs about aggression against Jews were very strong predictors of whether participants agreed to join. In Study 2, participants (N=92) were experimentally assigned to either a brief educational intervention, designed to improve inter-group relations, or to a control group. They also filled in self-report attitude measures pre and post intervention. Participants in the intervention group were much less likely to agree to join the extremist group, and this effect of the intervention on joining was mediated by changes in normative beliefs about aggression against Jews.

Les mesures de d\'esirabilit\'e de traits qui ne tiennent pas compte de cette diff\'erence de direction peuvent \^etre responsables des r\'esultats souvent contradictoires de divers chercheurs qui ont utilis\'e la m\'ethode dans le pass\'e. This article looks at paradata in the form of response latencies to identify socially desirable response behaviour. Response latencies are used as proxies to infer information processing modes. So far, evidence is conflicted as to whether socially desirable responding is indicated by shorter or longer response latencies. Our results show that faster responses are associated with the reporting of desirable attitudes and behaviour while slower responses are linked with those that are undesirable. Trait desirability measures that do not take this difference in direction into account may be responsible for the often contradictory results of various researchers who have employed the method in the past.},

  abstract = {A widely cited finding in social psychology holds that individuals with low levels of competence will judge themselves to be higher achieving than they really are. In the present study, I examine how the so-called ``Dunning-Kruger effect'' conditions citizens' perceptions of political knowledgeability. While low performers on a political knowledge task are expected to engage in overconfident self-placement and self-assessment when reflecting on their performance, I also expect the increased salience of partisan identities to exacerbate this phenomenon due to the effects of directional motivated reasoning. Survey experimental results confirm the Dunning-Kruger effect in the realm of political knowledge. They also show that individuals with moderately low political expertise rate themselves as increasingly politically knowledgeable when partisan identities are made salient. This below-average group is also likely to rely on partisan source cues to evaluate the political knowledge of peers. In a concluding section, I comment on the meaning of these findings for contemporary debates about rational ignorance, motivated reasoning, and political polarization.},

  abstract = {Human populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized. Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic, changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research, we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently, cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome: Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring. Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in supporting large-scale human cooperation.},

The new methods open up opportunities to study behavior in the field and to map causal processes, but they also pose new challenges. Recent work has added initial elevation bias to the list of common pitfalls; here, higher negative states (i.e., thoughts and feelings) are reported on the first day of assessment than on later days. This article showcases a new approach to addressing this and other measurement reactivity biases. Specifically, we employed a planned missingness design in a daily diary study of more than 1,300 individuals who were assessed over a period of up to 70 days to estimate and adjust for measurement reactivity biases. We found that day of first item presentation, item order, and item number were associated with only negligible bias: Items were not answered differently depending on when and where they were shown. Initial elevation bias may thus be more limited than has previously been reported or it may act only at the level of the survey, not at the item level. We encourage researchers to make design choices that will allow them to routinely assess measurement reactivity biases in their studies. Specifically, we advocate the routine randomization of item display and order, as well as of the timing and frequency of measurement. Randomized planned missingness makes it possible to empirically gauge how fatigue, familiarity, and learning interact to bias responses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Dystopian scenarios like the malicious amplification of topics, the spreading of disinformation, and the manipulation of elections through ``opinion machines'' created headlines around the globe. As a consequence, much research effort has been put into the classification and detection of social bots. Yet, it is still unclear how easy an average online media user can purchase social bots, which platforms they target, where they originate from, and how sophisticated these bots are. This work provides a much needed new perspective on these questions. By providing insights into the markets of social bots in the clearnet and darknet as well as an exhaustive analysis of freely available software tools for automation during the last decade, we shed light on the availability and capabilities of automated profiles in social media platforms. Our results confirm the increasing importance of social bot technology but also uncover an as yet unknown discrepancy of theoretical and practically achieved artificial intelligence in social bots: while literature reports on a high degree of intelligence for chat bots and assumes the same for social bots, the observed degree of intelligence in social bot implementations is limited. In fact, the overwhelming majority of available services and software are of supportive nature and merely provide modules of automation instead of fully fledged ``intelligent'' social bots.},

We use data from a food choice experiment administered across three countries and estimate a panel Mixed Multinomial Logit Model to obtain individual-specific utility weights. These are used to construct two utility-based measures of contextual choice complexity, which are combined with subjective measures of cognitive resources as well as indicators of opt-out selection. We first develop and then test hypothesized effects of complexity at the level of single choice task and choice sequence on response times. By using a log-linear random effects model with choice task response-time as dependent variable, we isolate these effects from other background variables. Results suggest that as our measures of complexity increase, so do response times and such effects are robust across the three countries. We argue that these results broadly support the validity of web-based choice surveys to measure food preference. We suggest that computers can help improve survey design by implementing algorithms to improve the overall efficiency of choice tasks design, for example, by using adaptive design algorithms that control cognitive challenges in accordance with the respondent's predicted ability to tackle cognitive effort.},

His book The Evolution of Cooperation has been hailed as a seminal contribution and has been translated into eight languages since its initial publication. The Complexity of Cooperation is a sequel to that landmark book. It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the field. The articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction between individuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system. The Complexity of Cooperation is essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in issues of cooperation and complexity.},

In the event of violations, a social media brand or organization renders an apology \textendash{} a form of social account \textendash{} to alleviate users' concerns and maintain user membership and engagement with the platform. To explore the link between apology offered by a social media brand or organization and the users' trust dynamics in the brand's services, we study how organizational integrity can contribute to reducing individuals' privacy concerns whiles increasing or repairing their trust. Drawing on organizational behavioral integrity literature, our proposed research model suggests that the persuasiveness of an apology following a data breach affects users' trust or spillover trust through their perceptions of the degree of alignment between the words in the apology and the actions of the violating entity. Based on a survey of Facebook users, our findings show that persuasiveness of an apology has a significant impact on users' perceptions of the alignment between the social media brand's (i.e. Facebook) words and subsequent actions. These perceptions impact social media brand trust (i.e. users' trust in Facebook and allied services such as Instagram). We also find that, post data breach incidence, while integrity of the social media organization partially mediates the relationship between persuasive apology and users' trust, it fully mediates the relationship between the persuasive apology and the privacy concerns expressed by the users. However, users' privacy concerns do not contribute much to the repair of trust needed to maintain their membership.},

  abstract = {Theory of Mind (ToM) may be defined as the ability to understand the mental states, such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions, of others. Impairment of ToM ability leads to disorders with pathologies in social skills, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In addition to differences in ToM ability among patient populations, there is variation between neurotypical individuals. Unfortunately, ToM tasks are usually developed for children or patients with cognitive disorders and cannot detect variations in healthy adults. As an alternative tool, humor may be used. Humor plays a role in social communication and requires many different cognitive functions. Humor is believed to represent complex high-order cognitive processes. There are numerous types of humor; the most complex type is considered ToM humor, where an understanding of social/emotional content is necessary. Given the need for a ToM assessment test suitable for healthy adult populations, we developed a test for measuring humor comprehension and appreciation, with and without ToM content (ToM-HCAT). The present ToM-HCAT test is a performance test consisting of cartoons. The test measures perceived funniness, reaction time to perceived funniness decision, and meaning inference. Cartoons were selected after pilot studies involving 44 participants. Subscales were constituted according to expert views and confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis (N = 135). Goodness of fit values for the final 35-item test were acceptable to excellent: GFI = 0.97; AGFI = 0.97; NFI = 0.97; RFI = 0.97, and SRMR = 0.067. Both categories were internally consistent ({$\alpha$}1 = 0.84, {$\alpha$}2 = 0.94). External validity was assessed against autistic traits. One hundred and three participants completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient and were grouped by +0.5 standard deviations from the mean as high in autistic traits. The meaning-inference scores of the subscale with the ToM cartoons were significantly lower (p = 0.034) for the high autistic traits group, providing evidence of external validity. In conclusion, we developed and validated a test for assessment of ToM by humor comprehension and appreciation. We believe that the present test will be useful for the detection of variations in ToM ability in the healthy adult population.},

Participants underwent functional MRI while they considered personally reading and sharing New York Times articles. Activity in neural regions involved in positive valuation, self-related processing, and taking the perspective of others was significantly associated with decisions to select and share articles, and scaled with preferences to do so. Activity in all three sets of regions was greater when participants considered sharing articles with other people rather than selecting articles to read themselves. The findings suggest that people may consider value not only to themselves but also to others even when selecting news articles to consume personally. Further, sharing heightens activity in these pathways, in line with our proposal that humans derive value from self-reflection and connecting to others via sharing. \textcopyright{} 2017, \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2017.},

To address this, we have proposed a model that learns hidden correlations between profile attributes within OSN communities, and exploits them to assist users in estimating the trustworthiness of new profiles. To demonstrate our method, we suggest, in this demo, a game application through which players try to cheat the system and convince nodes in a simulated OSN to befriend them. The game deploys different strategies to challenge the players and to reach the objectives of the demo. These objectives are to make participants aware of how fake accounts can infiltrate within their OSN communities, to demonstrate how our suggested method could aid in mitigating this threat, and to eventually strengthen our model based on the data collected from the moves of the players.},

Starting from the vision of empowering users to determine the validity of OSN identities, we suggest a framework to estimate the trustworthiness of online social profiles based only on the information they contain. Our framework is based on learning identity correlations between profile attributes in an OSN community and on collecting ratings from OSN community members to evaluate the trustworthiness of target profiles. Our system guarantees utility, user anonymity, impartiality in rating, and operability within the dynamics and continuous evolution of OSNs. In this article, we detail the system design, and we prove its correctness against these claimed quality properties. Moreover, we test its effectiveness, feasibility, and efficiency through experimentation on real-world datasets from Facebook and Google+, in addition to using the Adults UCI dataset.},

Literature offers several proposals addressing issues related to identity breaches and/or identity related attacks on OSNs, but only a few aim at giving means to judge users' reliability in terms of trustworthiness of their claimed identities. In this paper, we propose an identity validation process that relies on OSN community feedback to assign to OSN users identity trustworthiness levels. For this purpose, we define a community based supervised learning process to detect the set of attributes in a user profile for which it is expected to see a correlation among their values (e.g., job and salary). Once these correlated attribute sets are identified, the profile of a target user is judged by a selected group of raters to estimate her identity trustworthiness level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal through experimentation under two different scenarios and using real data. The experiments' results under the two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and meaningfulness of our proposal. \textcopyright{} 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This study provides a review of the theories relevant to the understanding of online dating. Dating as a concept and as an activity has a specific history and takes a specific form. It traditionally occurred in the offline world although there were mediated aspects to it with daters advertising themselves in newspapers and magazines and on other available platforms. There are theories that try to explain the dating process and how relationships form between humans. There are associated theories of impression formation which are not exclusive to the dating context but are nonetheless relevant to it. There is then the migration of these various theories from the offline into the online world. This paper reviews all this theoretical evidence through focusing on two key elements. The first is the efficacy with which offline theories can explain behavior in the online world and the importance of new developments in the explanation of interpersonal relationships and communications in the online world. The second is the cultural specificity of specific theories and any research that has been produced to test them.},

By mapping the electronic database containing all relevant journals in mathematics and neuro-science for an 8-year period (1991-98), we infer the dynamic and the structural mechanisms that govern the evolution and topology of this complex system. Three complementary approaches allow us to obtain a detailed characterization. First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities. The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and external links. However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases. Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time evolution. In some limits the model can be solved analytically, predicting a two-regime scaling in agreement with the measurements. Third, numerical simulations are used to uncover the behavior of quantities that could not be predicted analytically. The combined numerical and analytical results underline the important role internal links play in determining the observed scaling behavior and network topology. The results and methodologies developed in the context of the co-authorship network could be useful for a systematic study of other complex evolving networks as well, such as the world wide web, Internet, or other social networks.},

The study aims to contribute to existing knowledge in information disclosure behaviour and protective behaviour. The empirical research consists of thirty (30) PhD research scholars from the Department of Library and Information Science; Economics and Commerce of North-Eastern Hill University. These scholars' were selected using a convenient sampling technique to get a prompt response. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyse the data. The results showed that research scholar's information need on research topic accounted to (60\%) daily and used the Internet daily. The findings showed that most research scholars' do not trust the website and consider their personal information as unsafe on the web. Most of them reported having refused to give their personal identifiable information while considerable percentages are unfamiliar with the privacy emerging technologies (Example: Tor browser, Remove malware/Spyware, cookies, anonymous browsing, etc.). This study provides guidelines for the research scholars' to protect their personal information, thus, preventing scholars from privacy risks. The study contributes new knowledge concerning privacy concerns thus, broadened the context of personal disclosure in the online scenario.},

This systematic literature review explores the different theories on the phenomenon known as the privacy paradox.Drawing on a sample of 32 full papers that explore 35 theories in total, we determined that a user's decision-making process as it pertains to the willingness to divulge privacy information is generally driven by two considerations: (1) risk-benefit evaluation and (2) risk assessment deemed be none or negligible. By classifying in accordance with these two considerations, we have compiled a comprehensive model using all the variables mentioned in the discussed papers. The overall findings of the systematic literature review will investigate the nature of decision-making (rational vs. irrational) and the context in which the privacy paradox takes place, with a special focus on mobile computing. Furthermore, possible solutions and research limitation issues will be discussed.},

Earlier research into the privacy paradox has a number of caveats. Most studies focus on intentions rather than behavior and the influence of technical knowledge, privacy awareness, and financial resources is not systematically ruled out. This study therefore tests the privacy paradox under extreme circumstances, focusing on actual behavior and eliminating the effects of a lack of technical knowledge, privacy awareness, and financial resources. We designed an experiment on the downloading and usage of a mobile phone app among technically savvy students, giving them sufficient money to buy a paid-for app. Results suggest that neither technical knowledge and privacy awareness nor financial considerations affect the paradoxical behavior observed in users in general. Technically-skilled and financially independent users risked potential privacy intrusions despite their awareness of potential risks. In their considerations for selecting and downloading an app, privacy aspects did not play a significant role; functionality, app design, and costs appeared to outweigh privacy concerns.},

The search in this study focused on articles published between 1996 and 2019 and yielded 970 articles. After excluding duplicates and screening for eligibility, we were left with 13 articles in which the investigators developed a total of 16 survey scales. In addition to reviewing the conceptualizations, contexts, and dimensionalities of the scales, we evaluated the quality of methodological procedures used in the scale development process, drawing upon the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) Risk of Bias checklist. The results confirmed that the breadth of conceptualizations and dimensions of information privacy concerns are constructed with a low emphasis on contextuality.

Findings confirm the existence of four dimensions: (1) belief in the value of ``privacy as a right''; (2) ``other-contingent privacy''; (3) ``concern about own informational privacy'' and (4) ``concern about privacy of others.'' Moreover, a segmentation of SNS users based on these attitude scores reveals three types of users: (1) privacy advocates, who are concerned about both their own and other people's privacy; (2) privacy individualists, who are concerned mostly about their own privacy, and (3) privacy indifferents, whose score on all dimensions are lower than other segments. The results indicate that the four privacy orientation dimensions and three user segments predict key differences in terms of privacy protective behavior, information disclosure, and viewing personal information of others.},

  abstract = {One of a group's most valuable resources is the expertise of its members. How this expertise is (or is not) used has a major impact on group performance. However, determining expertise is often difficult. Thus the issue of how many group members need to be aware of expertise before the benefits of recognition accrue is of great importance. For example, do all members have to be aware of expertise prior to discussion for the group to benefit, or is a subset of members sufficient? If a subset is sufficient, how large must it be? To address these questions, we manipulated the number of group members possessing foreknowledge of member expertise. We then analyzed perceived expertise, information sharing, information weighting, and group decision making using a series of planned contrasts representing common social combination models. Discussion of unique information followed a majority wins model (i.e., a shift occurred when greater than half of members were made aware of expertise prior to discussion). For weighting of unique information, several models, including majority wins, fit when examining regression-based estimates of weighting whereas only the majority wins model fit when examining self-reported weighting. None of the models tested adequately explained rated expertise.},

The framework specifies two broad mechanisms to account for the three forms of misresponse: lack of motivation to process items in detail (``inattention'') and lack of ability to comprehend items accurately (``difficulty''). The authors propose a procedure to identify potential misresponse effects on the observed item responses and factor loadings, and they report two empirical studies to test the framework; the second study uses eye movement recordings to examine the underlying process. The findings reveal that polar opposite, reversed, and negated items contribute to misresponse to varying degrees and that difficulty rather than inattention may be a more potent cause of misresponse in surveys than has traditionally been acknowledged.},

Goldberg's Big Five Factors of personality, a contextualized theory of reasoned action (TRA-privacy), and recent literature on customer experience are used to develop and propose a conceptual research model. The model was tested using survey data from 224 US-based voice shoppers. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). PLS-SEM revealed that trust and privacy concerns mediate the relationship between personality (agreeableness, emotional instability, and conscientiousness) and voice shoppers' perceptions of customer experience performance. FsQCA reveals the combinations of these factors that lead to high perceptions of customer experience performance. This study contributes to voice shopping literature, which is a relatively understudied area of e-commerce research yet an increasingly popular shopping method.},

  abstract = {Today, personal data is being actively traded, and in most cases even without the awareness of the data subjects. The regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require data controllers and processors to be compliant with many preconditions. And this positively influences the transparency of the data processing, however, there are still many lawful grounds for processing personal data, and often, this still leaves data subjects outside of the monetization of their personal data. And while the ownership of data is still an open discussion, many initiatives and scholarly works have been aimed at restoring the balance and giving the control over data back to the data subjects. This is especially important in the healthcare industry, where research organizations and pharmaceutical companies have grasped everything that was possible from anonymized data and shifted the demand toward personal health data with updating insides from the data subjects themselves and their connected devices, such as smart watches. This requires a different approach, and in author's opinion a data marketplace for personal data. The author suggests a model of a data marketplace within the territory of European Union (EU). So this work discusses the the current EU legislations, how currently data is being monetized and sold, how many scholars see the potential model of the data marketplace and any other data sharing or trading platform, and the model proposed by the author, and the potential legal issues related to the creation of such a marketplace.},

And although estimates have been made on whether the data moving in the digital economy flow are from sensors or machines or come from each of us, one thing is certain, all information has a monetary value. Within this flow of information are our personal data. Every moment that we use an electronic device we leave behind vestiges of our life, which are collected by the machines to generate value to the companies. In this way our information is subject to market rules, supply and demand. We have become intangible beings, mercantilized, giving our bodies of data to the science, innovation and technological development. With the use of technologies such as Big Data and IoT, more information less is better. The speed with which our information is collected and treated as well as commercialized is undermining confidence in the digital market. Concern about the misuse of our personal data, or about the information we know about us, raises fundamental questions about privacy, ownership of information and human rights. The question of who should benefit from products and services based on digital data (generated by users) are the main uncertainties that shape the digital market opportunities. But, how can we measure trust in companies if we are not aware of the value our personal information has in the digital economy? What is the value that, as headlines, we give to our personal data? Perhaps therein lies the problem of allowing others to have power over our information. To promote the digital market and trust in it, we need to know the value of our information. Becoming aware of the fact and consequences of collecting our data, as well as its monetary value and importance in the digital economy, is the first beneficial step towards the empowerment of our information},

Becker's essays over the years have inevitably inspired a surge of research activity in testimony to the richness of his insights into human activities lying 'outside' the traditionally conceived economic markets.

Agent-based modelling of this behaviour, using evolutionary approaches, further provides a powerful tool to examine the implications of these theories in a dynamic context. In particular, this can enhance our understanding of the escalation of hostility and warfare, and its mitigation, contributing to policy and interventions. In this paper we propose a framework through which social psychology can be embedded in computation for the examination of inter-group behaviour. We examine how various social-psychological theories can be embedded in evolutionary models, and identify ways in which visualisation can support the objective assessment of emergent behaviour. We also discuss how real-world data can be used to parameterise scenarios on which modelling is conducted.},

We suggest that management researchers face ethical issues of a different nature to those most frequently confronted by other social science researchers, and argue for more explicit acknowledgement of contextual factors involved in management research. An exploratory analysis of the content of ethics codes formulated by nine social scientific associations is undertaken to identify the main ethical principles they cover and to analyse their underlying ethical tone. Drawing attention to the principle of reciprocity, which is found in very few codes, we suggest that an ethics code could be used to formulate new ways of thinking about management research relationships. Despite the risk that ethics codes may encourage instrumental compliance with minimal ethical obligations, we suggest they also have the potential to reflect a more aspirational agenda. The development of an ethics code for management research should therefore be seen as a potentially worthwhile project.},

  abstract = {Core precepts of the Silicon Valley technology culture include disruption, breaking things, and profiting from the results. As technologies run ahead of regulatory regimes, a great deal of attention has been paid to the organization and evaluation of regulatory processes, from corporate self-regulation, to direct state intervention, and multiple stakeholder governance. However, it is less clear what values or principles should animate these approaches. Public discussions and academic literatures have identified at least four critical areas that require attention: data market and business monopolies; moral dilemmas of AI, such as surveillance and behavioral engineering; a variety of environmental harms; and the spread of hate, disinformation and attacks on liberal democratic values. This analysis develops a holistic framework of guiding principles to address these different problem areas. Without a set of widely shared guiding principles, regulatory approaches will remain fragmentary and weak. Policies in one area may miss or even create problems in others. The aim is not to impose a priori solutions on complex problems, but to offer scholars, regulators, and stakeholders a heuristic framework to guide policy thinking. \textcopyright{} 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {The first five volumes of the \emph{Correspondence of Jeremy Bentham} contain over 1,300 letters written both to and from Bentham over a 50-year period, beginning in 1752 (aged three) with his earliest surviving letter to his grandmother, and ending in 1797 with correspondence concerning his attempts to set up a national scheme for the provision of poor relief. Against the background of the debates on the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789, to which he made significant contributions, Bentham worked first on producing a complete penal code, which involved him in detailed explorations of fundamental legal ideas, and then on his panopticon prison scheme. Despite developing a host of original and ground-breaking ideas, contained in a mass of manuscripts, he published little during these years, and remained, at the close of this period, a relatively obscure individual. Nevertheless, these volumes reveal how the foundations were laid for the remarkable rise of Benthamite utilitarianism in the early nineteenth century. Bentham's early life is marked by his extraordinary precociousness, but also family tragedy: by the age of 10 he had lost five infant siblings and his mother. The letters in this volume document his difficult relationship with his father and his increasing attachment to his surviving younger brother Samuel, his education, his interest in chemistry and botany, and his committing himself to a life of philosophy and legal reform.},

In light of recent findings, Machiavellian social skills are not limited to emotion regulation and ``cold-mindedness'' as many authors have recently stated, but linked to specific cognitive abilities. Although Machiavellians appear to have a relatively poor mindreading ability and emotional intelligence, they can efficiently exploit others which is likely to come from their flexible problem solving processes in changing environmental circumstances. The author proposed that Machiavellians have specialized cognitive domains of decision making, such as monitoring others' behavior, task orientation, reward seeking, inhibition of cooperative feelings, and choosing victims. He related the relevant aspects of cognitive functions to their neurological substrates, and argued why they make Machiavellians so successful in interpersonal relationships.},

  abstract = {In the modern society collection of data happens everywhere, and consequently, privacy is an ever-growing concern. It has been shown that people, and especially teenagers, lack awareness around the data they share and the associated privacy risks. Furthermore, no one has taken on the responsibility of training teenagers to become responsible digital users with a good understanding of the privacy risks they expose themselves to. A lot of focus is dedicated to raising awareness around what to share and not to share on social networks, but little is done to learn about the risks of the digital footprints left by simply using digital services. Services may seem free of charge; however, they are not paid for with money - but with personal information. In smart cities, data is collected about the citizens across a multitude of small digital sensors, which raise privacy concerns on how the information can and should be used. This thesis explores how chatbot serious games can be used as a tool to raise privacy awareness. The focus is on which game elements work well in a chatbot serious game - both to engage the player, and to raise his awareness. To answer this we have conducted a literature review on existing chatbot serious games, designed and developed PrivaCity as a chatbot prototype for a serious game to raise privacy awareness on digital risks in smart cities. The game and its elements have been evaluated with 104 Norwegian teenagers as participants. Finally, based on the experiences made in the previous steps, a set of guidelines for chatbot serious games is presented. The guidelines can be used by anyone wishing to design or develop a chatbot serious game. Through the evaluation of the game PrivaCity, it is found that the game elements that work best for learning and raising awareness in a chatbot serious game are quizzes, real-life examples and seeing the consequences of one's actions. The game elements that work best to engage the player are curiosity and being able to explore freely, and to shape the narrative and story of the game with actions. The game PrivaCity mainly focuses on the privacy concerns of a smart city. But by utilizing the knowledge and guidelines presented in this report, one can also design a successful chatbot serious game for other scenarios or problem domains.},

  abstract = {Indirect reciprocity describes a class of reputation-based mechanisms which may explain the prevalence of cooperation in large groups where partners meet only once. The first model for which this has been demonstrated was the image scoring mechanism. But analytical work on the simplest possible case, the binary scoring model, has shown that even small errors in implementation destabilize any cooperative regime. It has thus been claimed that for indirect reciprocity to stabilize cooperation, assessments of reputation must be based on higher-order information. Is indirect reciprocity relying on first-order information doomed to fail? We use a simple analytical model of image scoring to show that this need not be the case. Indeed, in the general image scoring model the introduction of implementation errors has just the opposite effect as in the binary scoring model: it may stabilize instead of destabilize cooperation.},

Either mate-preferences are assumed to be uniform (e.g., all females have the same preferences with respect to males), or mate-choice is assumed to be a one-sided affair (e.g., females do all the choosing). Recent empirical studies suggest that in many cases, neither assumption holds. In this paper, we show how two-sided matching - a branch of game theory developed in the economics literature - can be used to model mutual mate choice with non-uniform mate preferences. The economics literature is reviewed, and a number of biological applications are suggested. We charactize a systematic conflict of interest between males and females over the optimal matchings in mutual mate choice systems. Moreover, we observe that the component of choice that confers the major benefit in this conflict is not choice in the conventional sense of accepting or rejecting courtships, but instead the power to choose the individuals to whom one displays.},

  abstract = {Blockchains offer a decentralized, immutable and verifiable ledger that can record transactions of digital assets, provoking a radical change in several innovative scenarios, such as smart cities, eHealth or eGovernment. However, blockchains are subject to different scalability, security and potential privacy issues, such as transaction linkability, crypto-keys management (e.g. recovery), on-chain data privacy, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology. The survey covers privacy techniques in public and permissionless blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as privacy-preserving research proposals and solutions in permissioned and private blockchains. Diverse blockchain scenarios are analyzed, encompassing, eGovernment, eHealth, cryptocurrencies, Smart cities, and Cooperative ITS. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.},

We begin by describing /b/ and performing a content analysis that suggests the community is dominated by playful exchanges of images and links. Our first study uses a large dataset of more than five million posts to quantify ephemerality in /b/. We find that most threads spend just five seconds on the first page and less than five minutes on the site before expiring. Our second study is an analysis of identity signals on 4chan, finding that over 90\% of posts are made by fully anonymous users, with other identity signals adopted and discarded at will. We describe alternative mechanisms that /b/ participants use to establish status and frame their interactions.},

This research-in-progress explores the root causes of this privacy paradox, the role of personal information privacy threats on trust in emerging technologies, and the influence of unconscious decision-making (based on virtue ethics traditions) on conscious decision-making. To understand the duality and subjectivity embedded in the above issues, this study applies Q-methodology for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The study proposes that virtue ethics is the best approach to solve such subjective issues. This study enhances our understanding, on the basis of prior literature, of the importance of virtue ethics as a solution to the privacy paradox.},

Skills can be either revealed or kept hidden, but while agents on one side have verifiable skills, agents on the other side have skills that are unverifiable unless certified, and certification is costly. Agents who have revealed their skill enter a standard matching market, while others are matched randomly. We find that in equilibrium only agents with skills above a cutoff reveal, and then they match assortatively. We show that an equilibrium always exists, and we discuss multiplicity. Increasing differences play an important role to shape equilibria, and we remark that this is unusual in matching models with non-transferable utility. We close the paper with some comparative statics exercises where we show the existence of non-trivial externalities and welfare implications.},

  abstract = {We present a model of continuous-time opinion dynamics for an arbitrary number of agents that communicate over a network and form real-valued opinions about an arbitrary number of options. The model generalizes linear and nonlinear models in the literature. Drawing from biology, physics, and social psychology, we introduce an attention parameter to modulate social influence and a saturation function to bound inter-agent and intra-agent opinion exchanges. This yields simply parameterized dynamics that exhibit the range of opinion formation behaviors predicted by model-independent bifurcation theory but not exhibited by linear models or existing nonlinear models. Behaviors include rapid and reliable formation of multistable consensus and dissensus states, even in homogeneous networks, as well as ultra-sensitivity to inputs, robustness to uncertainty, flexible transitions between consensus and dissensus, and opinion cascades. Augmenting the opinion dynamics with feedback dynamics for the attention parameter results in tunable thresholds that govern sensitivity and robustness. The model provides new means for systematic study of dynamics on natural and engineered networks, from information spread and political polarization to collective decision making and dynamic task allocation.},

At the same time, social influence, through social media, online reviews, or personal networks, is one of the most potent forces affecting individual decision-making. In three preregistered online experiments, we found that people rely more on algorithmic advice relative to social influence as tasks become more difficult. All three experiments focused on an intellective task with a correct answer and found that subjects relied more on algorithmic advice as difficulty increased. This effect persisted even after controlling for the quality of the advice, the numeracy and accuracy of the subjects, and whether subjects were exposed to only one source of advice, or both sources. Subjects also tended to more strongly disregard inaccurate advice labeled as algorithmic compared to equally inaccurate advice labeled as coming from a crowd of peers. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

In a rewards-based system that compensates agents for sharing, agents with active status motives demand relatively larger rewards. In a sacrifice-based system that does not compensate agents for sharing, agents with active status motives make larger sacrifices but only when sharing is visible to others. In brief, agents with active status motives show off in the manner the control system frames as easiest, that is, conspicuous value-signaling or conspicuous generosity-signaling. Broadly speaking, active status motives inhibit sharing when sharing involves rewards but decrease barriers when sharing involves sacrifice. Understanding the motivation for status is critical to motivating agent-to-agent sharing within firms.},

We compare this to the effects of providing groups with explicit feedback on member expertise. Results indicate that estimates generated both by groups in the bridge-building condition and groups with feedback were best predicted by a model assuming decisions to be weighted to reflect the accuracy of members on that and all previous estimates. When groups had neither intervention, their decisions were best fit by a model assuming group influence to be a function of member extroversion. Finally, results indicate that the bridge-building manipulation interacts with the type of problem solver generating the estimate such that groups improve whereas the performance of poor individual problem solvers further declines.

Th.o.m.a.s. is a semi-structured interview meant to evaluate a person's Theory of Mind (ToM). It is composed of several questions organized in four scales, each focusing on one of the areas of knowledge in which such faculty may manifest itself: Scale A (I-Me) investigates first-order first-person ToM; Scale B (Other-Self) investigates third-person ToM from an allocentric perspective; Scale C (I-Other) again investigates third-person ToM, but from an egocentric perspective; and Scale D (Other-Me) investigates second-order ToM. The psychometric proprieties of Th.o.m.a.s. were evaluated in a sample of 156 healthy persons: 80 preadolescent and adolescent (aged 11\textendash 17 years, 42 females) and 76 adults (aged from 20 to 67 years, 35 females). Th.o.m.a.s. scores show good inter-rater agreement and internal consistency; the scores increase with age. Evidence of criterion validity was found as Scale B scores were correlated with those of an independent instrument for the evaluation of ToM, the Strange Stories task. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed good fit of the four-factors theoretical model to the data, although the four factors were highly correlated. For each of the four scales, Rasch analyses showed that, with few exceptions, items fitted the Partial credit model and their functioning was invariant for gender and age. The results of this study, along with those of previous researches with clinical samples, show that Th.o.m.a.s. is a promising instrument to assess ToM in different populations.},

We argue that such problems could be partly alleviated with increased engagement with a meta-theoretical perspective that has long been advocated for in psychology\textemdash the systems approach. In this view, thought, feeling, motivation, action, and context can be viewed as co-evolving, inextricably linked, systems of systems.

This article explores these issues by employing in-depth interviews and explorative usability tests, comparing the experiences and usage of younger and older Facebook users. First, the interviews revealed that Facebook users in all age groups reported more contact with several different groups of people, which reflects different types of social capital (i.e., family, friends, and acquaintances), because of Facebook, but not without consequences for privacy. Having too many Facebook ``friends'' and access to different social capital disrupt the sharing process due to experiences of social surveillance and social control. This social control often forces younger people in particular to use conformity as a strategy when sharing content to maintain their privacy. Further, the interviews revealed different motivations and usage patterns when older and younger users are compared. Second, the usability test found a significant difference between younger and older adults in time completion and task completion related to Facebook settings. Younger users are more skilled in their Facebook usage, whereas adults over the age of 40 have difficulties in understanding the navigation logic and privacy settings. Younger and older adults display completely open public profiles without realizing it. Finally, the design and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {The strong emotional reaction elicited by privacy issues is well documented (e.g., [12, 8]). The emotional aspect of privacy makes it difficult to evaluate privacy concern, and directly asking about a privacy issue may result in an emotional reaction and a biased response. This effect may be partly responsible for the dramatic privacy concern ratings coming from recent surveys, ratings that often seem to be at odds with user behavior. In this paper we propose indirect techniques for measuring content privacy concerns through surveys, thus hopefully diminishing any emotional response. We present a design for indirect surveys and test the design's use as (1) a means to measure relative privacy concerns across content types, (2) a tool for predicting unwillingness to share content (a possible indicator of privacy concern), and (3) a gauge for two underlying dimensions of privacy - content importance and the willingness to share content. Our evaluation consists of 3 surveys, taken by 200 users each, in which privacy is never asked about directly, but privacy warnings are issued with increasing escalation in the instructions and individual question-wording. We demonstrate that this escalation results in statistically and practically significant differences in responses to individual questions. In addition, we compare results against a direct privacy survey and show that rankings of privacy concerns are increasingly preserved as privacy language increases in the indirect surveys, thus indicating our mapping of the indirect questions to privacy ratings is accurately reflecting privacy concerns.},

Due to the new technological developments and solutions a new user of information systems evolved. Smart Mobile Devices (SMD) and software in form of mobile applications (apps) diffused into the everyday life of users. The download and usage of apps became ubiquitous and by giving away personal data while using apps, individuals put their privacy at risk. Privacy concerns are generally used to measure information privacy. However, privacy is highly context dependent and needs to be adapted to the investigated environment. Therefore, the authors developed a measurement for app information privacy concerns (AIPC), based on existing literature. A data set of 269 participants was analyzed. For the AIPC three first-order dimensions (anxiety, personal attitude, and requirements) were revealed.},

The evolutionary roots of human altruism, however, remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests a discontinuity between humans and other primates because individual chimpanzees do not spontaneously provide food to other group members, indicating a lack of concern for their welfare. Here, we demonstrate that common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) do spontaneously provide food to nonreciprocating and genetically unrelated individuals, indicating that other-regarding preferences are not unique to humans and that their evolution did not require advanced cognitive abilities such as theory of mind. Because humans and marmosets are cooperative breeders and the only two primate taxa in which such unsolicited prosociality has been found, we conclude that these prosocial predispositions may emanate from cooperative breeding.

  abstract = {Social networks have become a central feature of everyday life. Most young people are members of at least one online social network, and they naturally provide a great deal of personal information as a condition for participation in the rich online social lives these networks afford. Increasingly, this information is being used as evidence in criminal and even civil legal proceedings. These latter uses, by actors involved in the justice system, are typically justified on the grounds that social network information is essentially public in nature, and thus does not generate a subjective expectation of privacy necessary to support a civil rights-based privacy protection. This justification, however, is based on the perceptions of individuals who are outside the online social network community, rather than reflecting the norms and privacy practices of participants in online social networks. This project takes a user-centric approach to the question of whether online social spaces are public venues, examining of the information-related practices of social network participants, focusing on how they treat their own information and that of others posted in online social spaces. Our results reveal that online social spaces are indeed loci of public display rather than private revelation: online profiles are structured with the view that 'everyone' can see them, even if the explicitly intended audience is more limited. These social norms are inconsistent with the claim that social media are private spaces; instead, it appears that participants view and treat online social networks as public venues. \textcopyright{} 2013 Taylor \& Francis.},

We find that a social-psychological measure of Machiavellian behavior predicts distrust but not a lack of trustworthiness, and that non-white participants trust less in a predominantly white environment, but are no less trustworthy.},

We present five experiments testing key predictions of this account that are difficult to reconcile with alternative accounts based on cognitive or emotional limitations. Namely, we show that donors are more sensitive to efficacy when helping (1) themselves or (2) their families. Moreover, (3) social rewarders don't condition on efficacy or other difficult-to-observe behaviours (4, 5), such as the amount donated.},

On the contrary, when any of these conditions is violated, there exist preferences for which disclosure is strictly optimal, even if the downstream principal does not pay for the information. We also examine the effects of disclosure on welfare and show that it does not necessarily reduce the agent's surplus in the two relationships and in some cases may even yield a Pareto improvement.},

  year = {2003},
  month = mar,
  abstract = {Game theory, the formalized study of strategy, began in the 1940s by asking how emotionless geniuses should play games, but ignored until recently how average people with emotions and limited foresight actually play games. This book marks the first substantial and authoritative effort to close this gap. Colin Camerer, one of the field's leading figures, uses psychological principles and hundreds of experiments to develop mathematical theories of reciprocity, limited strategizing, and learning, which help predict what real people and companies do in strategic situations. Unifying a wealth of information from ongoing studies in strategic behavior, he takes the experimental science of behavioral economics a major step forward. He does so in lucid, friendly prose. Behavioral game theory has three ingredients that come clearly into focus in this book: mathematical theories of how moral obligation and vengeance affect the way people bargain and trust each other; a theory of how limits in the brain constrain the number of steps of "I think he thinks . . ." reasoning people naturally do; and a theory of how people learn from experience to make better strategic decisions. Strategic interactions that can be explained by behavioral game theory include bargaining, games of bluffing as in sports and poker, strikes, how conventions help coordinate a joint activity, price competition and patent races, and building up reputations for trustworthiness or ruthlessness in business or life. While there are many books on standard game theory that address the way ideally rational actors operate, Behavioral Game Theory stands alone in blending experimental evidence and psychology in a mathematical theory of normal strategic behavior. It is must reading for anyone who seeks a more complete understanding of strategic thinking, from professional economists to scholars and students of economics, management studies, psychology, political science, anthropology, and biology.},

In addition to the perceived level of inequality typically measured in previous studies, we explore perceptions about who is rich and poor and their share of the population. The shape of perceived inequality that we find provides new insights as to why people tolerate large differences between the rich and the poor. We find that Mexicans generally perceive poverty and inequality not too far from measured levels, but they overestimate the income of the rich and their proportion of the population. Their perceptions of social mobility correctly estimate persistence rates at the top and bottom of the distribution, but they overestimate upward and downward mobility. Providing people with more information about observed income inequality and social mobility could be one way to encourage a demand for redistribution. However, randomly providing selected participants with this information has almost zero effect on their desired levels of equality, social mobility, and tax rates. Finally, we find that Mexicans want a progressive tax system in which the poor pay an average tax rate of 14\% and the wealthy pay 41\%, and that preference for a more progressive tax structure is negatively related to socioeconomic status.},

  abstract = {Which social decisions are intuitive? Which are deliberative? The dual-process approach to human sociality has emerged in the last decades as a vibrant and exciting area of research. Here, I review the existing literature on the cognitive basis of cooperation, altruism, honesty, positive and negative reciprocity, and (act) utilitarianism. I conclude by introducing a game-theoretical framework that organizes the majority of the empirical regularities. This framework extends Rand and colleagues' Social Heuristics Hypothesis to any one-shot game G. The core assumption of this ``General Social Heuristics Hypothesis'' is that, under intuition, people play a Nash equilibrium of the ``real analogue of G'', G\^real, while under deliberation people play a Nash equilibrium of G. G\^real differs from G along two dimensions: G is one-shot, while G\^real might be iterated; the payoffs of G\^real might be different from the payoffs of G, although they are ordered in (almost) the same way.},

Content-dependent tasks allow students to draw on knowledge gained through traditional learning areas or subjects within the curriculum. The collaborative problem solving framework emphasises communication for the purpose of information gathering, identification of available and required information, identification and analysis of patterns in the data, formulation of contingencies or rules, generalisation of rules, and test hypotheses. Characteristics of tasks which were identified as appropriate for eliciting collaborative problem solving processes are reported and illustrated by exemplar items.},

  abstract = {People tend to form groups when they have to solve difficult problems because groups seem to have better problem-solving capabilities than individuals. Indeed, during their evolution, human beings learned that cooperation is frequently an optimal strategy to solve hard problems both quickly and accurately. The ability of a group to determine a solution to a given problem, once group members alone cannot, has been called ``Collective Intelligence". Such emergent property of the group as a whole is the result of a complex interaction between many factors. Here, we propose a simple and analytically solvable model disentangling the direct link between collective intelligence and the average intelligence of group members. We found that there is a non-linear relation between the collective intelligence of a group and the average intelligence quotient of its members depending on task difficulty. We found three regimes as follows: for simple tasks, the level of collective intelligence of a group is a decreasing function of teammates' intelligence quotient; when tasks have intermediate difficulties, the relation between collective intelligence and intelligence quotient shows a nonmonotone behaviour; for complex tasks, the level of collective intelligence of a group monotonically increases with teammates' intelligence quotient with phase transitions emerging when varying the latter's level. Although simple and abstract, our model paves the way for future experimental explorations of the link between task complexity, individual intelligence and group performance. \textcopyright{} 2020, University of Surrey.

Specialists of e-commerce have therefore explored the facets of online risk perception with the aim of identifying which has the greatest impact. There is, nonetheless, no consensus as to the facets of risk perception or their relative importance. This is the first study resorting to neurological tools that examines the differences between the three most widespread facets of risk (financial, privacy, and performance) in a low-involvement purchase environment. Contrary to behavioral findings, brain data from neurological analyses identify differences between the three facets of risk. Financial risk conveys the lowest subconscious aversion and negative values. Subconscious privacy risk, in turn, confers ambivalence and uncertainty while performance risk elicits the highest levels of disappointment and distrust. Implications from the current findings, if taken into account by retailers, can greatly improve web contents and purchase processes, and bolster sales.},

This trace is potentially valuable for research on human-computer interaction (HCI) and for investigating perceptual, cognitive and affective processes during HCI. However, little research has reported spatio-temporal pointer features for the purpose of tracking pointer movements in on-line surveys. In two studies, we identified a set of pointer features and movement patterns and showed that these can be easily distinguished. In a third study, we explored the feasibility of using patterns of interactive pointer movements, or micro-behaviours, to detect response uncertainty. Using logistic regression and k-fold cross-validation in model training and testing, the uncertainty model achieved an estimated performance accuracy of 81\%. These findings suggest that micro-behaviours provide a promising approach toward developing a better understanding of the relationship between the dynamics of pointer movements and underlying perceptual, cognitive and affective psychological mechanisms.},

While this measure has been shown to be sensitive to age-related ToM difficulties, there are no established cutoffs or guidelines currently available that are specific to older adults. This article seeks to validate a short-form version of the RMET appropriate for use in such populations. Methods Cross-sectional data from 295 participants (mean age 86 years) from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, a longitudinal community observational cohort. Participants underwent an assessment battery that included the RMET. Individuals who scored {$>$}1SD below the RMET scores of cognitively normal participants were deemed to have below average RMET scores. Various model-building methods were used to generate short-form solutions of the RMET, which were compared with previously validated versions in their predictive power for below average full RMET performance. Results Individuals with below average RMET performance tended to be older and have poorer global cognition. Of the eight short-form solutions, the 21-item version generated using genetic algorithm exhibited the best classification performance with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.98 and had 93.2\% accuracy in classifying individuals with below average ToM. A shorter 10-item solution derived by ant colony optimization also had acceptable performance. Conclusion We recommend the 21-item version of the RMET for use in older adult populations for identifying individuals with impaired ToM. Where an even shorter version is needed with a trade-off of slightly reduced performance, the 10-item version is acceptable.},

Methodology: 68 subjects (35 men and 33 women) were assessed for quality of life and psychological morbidity using WHOQOL-BREF and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Details of disclosure were collected using a semistructured interview. Results: Certain disclosure-related variables appear to relate significantly with quality of life among HIV-infected persons. A positive outcome related to disclosure and extent to which a subject felt the need to disclose were significantly associated with higher scores on the total quality of life measure and in the social and environmental domains of the WHOQOL-BREF. No relationship was found between disclosure-related variables and psychological morbidity or other domains of quality of life. The type of disclosure (voluntary/without consent) did not appear to influence quality of life in this sample. Conclusion: Disclosure-related variables may have an important influence on QOL in the context of HIV infection in India.},

From learning new skills by observing parents perform them to~making complex collective decisions, understanding the mechanisms underlying social cognitive processes has been of considerable interest to psychologists and neuroscientists. Here, we review studies that have used computational modelling techniques, combined with neuroimaging, to shed light on how people learn and make decisions in social contexts. As opposed to standard social neuroscience methods, the computational approach allows one to directly examine where in the brain particular computations, as estimated by models of behavior, are implemented. Findings suggest that people use several strategies to~learn from others: vicarious reward learning, where one learns from observing the reward outcomes of another agent; action imitation, which relies on encoding a prediction error between the expected and actual actions of the other agent; and social inference, where one learns by inferring the goals and intentions of others. These computations are implemented in~distinct neural networks, which may be recruited adaptively depending on task demands, the environment and other social factors. \textcopyright{} 2018, \textcopyright{} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Smart contracts handle and transfer assets of considerable value (in the form of crypto-currency like Bitcoin). Hence, it is crucial that their implementation is bug-free. We identify the utility (or expected payoff) of interacting with such smart contracts as the basic and canonical quantitative property for such contracts. We present a framework for such quantitative analysis of smart contracts. Such a formal framework poses new and novel research challenges in programming languages, as it requires modeling of game-theoretic aspects to analyze incentives for deviation from honest behavior and modeling utilities which are not specified as standard temporal properties such as safety and termination. While game-theoretic incentives have been analyzed in the security community, their analysis has been restricted to the very special case of stateless games. However, to analyze smart contracts, stateful analysis is required as it must account for the different program states of the protocol. Our main contributions are as follows: we present (i)\textasciitilde a simplified programming language for smart contracts; (ii)\textasciitilde an automatic translation of the programs to state-based games; (iii)\textasciitilde an abstraction-refinement approach to solve such games; and (iv)\textasciitilde experimental results on real-world-inspired smart contracts.},

The model was later empirically validated using the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique with 367 respondents from India. Findings The study finds that CPC significantly impacts on consumer behavior in using smartphones for financial transactions. The study also highlights that regulation has a moderating impact on consumer usage of smartphones for financial transactions. Research limitations/implications This study provides valuable inputs to smartphone service providers, practitioners, regulatory authorities and policymakers on appropriate and secure usage of smartphones by consumers, ensuring privacy protection while making financial transactions. Originality/value This study provides a unique model showing the antecedents of CPC to impact the behavioral reaction of smartphone users mediated through the ingredients of privacy calculus theory. Besides, this study analyzes the moderating effects of regulation on the use of smartphones for financial transactions. This is also a novel approach of this study.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a method that combines the merits of Bayesian nonparametrics, specifically stick-breaking priors, and largemargin kernel machines in the context of sequential data classification. The proposed model employs a set of (theoretically) infinite interdependent large-margin classifiers as model components, that robustly capture local nonlinearity of complex data. The employed large-margin classifiers are connected in the context of a Markov-switching construction that allows for capturing complex temporal dynamics in the modeled datasets. Appropriate stick-breaking priors are imposed over the component switching mechanism of our model to allow for data-driven determination of the optimal number of component large-margin classifiers, under a standard nonparametric Bayesian inference scheme. Efficient model training is performed under the maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework, which integrates the large-margin principle with Bayesian posterior inference. We evaluate our method using several real-world datasets, and compare it to state-of-the-art alternatives.},

Subjects are exposed to four scenarios that describe a method of personal data collection, involving either brand-name companies or generic descriptors of companies. After each scenario, subjects rate how acceptable they find the practice of data collection, along with the frequency and quality of experiences that they have had with the company (for brand names) or type of company (for generic descriptors). Judgments of perceived acceptability are analyzed, both across the portfolio of judgments and within each separate scenario. While analyses of each separate scenario point to the context-dependency of the perceived acceptability of data collection, several results stand out when analyzing the subjects' portfolios of responses in the aggregate. Higher generalized trust is linked to a higher average acceptability rating, and the effect is stronger when companies are described with brand names rather than generic descriptors. Uniformly, however, no relationship is found between need for cognitive closure and perceived acceptability. Additionally, positive experiences are found to be a stronger predictor of perceived acceptability of data collection than frequency of use. \textcopyright{} 2018 by the author.

Here, we propose a way to reconcile these two opposing frameworks. We argue that behavior attributed to intuition can instead be seen as a starting point bias of a sequential sampling model (SSM) process, analogous to a prior in a Bayesian framework. Using mini-dictator games in which subjects make binary decisions about how to allocate money between themselves and another participant, we find that pro-social subjects become more pro-social under time pressure and less pro-social under time delay, while selfish subjects do the opposite. Our findings help reconcile the conflicting results concerning the cognitive processes of social decision making and highlight the importance of modeling the dynamics of the choice process.},

Several mechanisms have been proposed, among which reputation-based indirect reciprocity and spatial locality are two of the majors. However, only a few studies about their interaction exist. Here, we considered an agent-based model in a two-dimensional continuous space where not only the game-based interaction but also the transmission of agents' reputation take place based on the spatial locality. Agents have one of the following three strategies as their gene: always defect, always cooperate or discriminate based on the recipient's reputation. We tested four assessment rules in indirect reciprocity: Shunning, Stern Judging, Image Scoring and Simple Standing. We found that without mobility, first, as the spatial locality gets weaker, the cooperation rate drops. Second, for cooperation to evolve from an all-defector environment, the cluster of discriminators is necessary. We added mobility so that an agent will get closer to the one who donated to her and far away from the one who defected against her. We found that if the movement duration is long enough, a higher cooperation rate could be promoted. \textcopyright{} 2020, International Society of Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB).},

Should a member of an online social network be offered decision control to veto ex-ante the disclosure of his/her information by peers? There has been no theoretical research on the effectiveness of decisional control to alleviate such a privacy concern. Drawing on the communication privacy management perspective and the impression management theory, this study proposes a three-way interaction effect among three important antecedents of IPCPD: 1) decisional control; 2) image discrepancy (i.e., the degree to which the disclosed information portrays an unfavorable image of the disclosed person); and 3) social network overlap between the disclosed person and the discloser. Our experimental study reveals significant findings. When image discrepancy is low, decisional control is helpful only when the social network overlap between the disclosed one and the discloser is low. When image discrepancy is high, decisional control is helpful only when the social network overlap between the disclosed one and the discloser is high. This study contributes to a theory of privacy concern about peer disclosure in the context of online social networks.},

  abstract = {Rationale Health digitalization raises important challenges for personal health-data management. Particularly, the advantages underlying the implementation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) remain limited in many countries due to patients' privacy concerns. Objective Drawing on the privacy calculus theory, the objective of this research is to introduce personal health concerns and trust in healthcare providers as new predictors, beyond the constituent variables of the privacy calculus model - the perceived benefits and risk. We propose and test a conceptual model that investigates simultaneously the effects of these four variables on patients' privacy concerns and intention to share personal health-data on EHR. Method A cross-sectional study using an on online survey was administered from December 2019 to February 2020 in France to both users and non-users of EHR. A structural equation modelling was used to assess the reliability and validity of the measurement as well as to test the research hypotheses. Results The results confirm the positive effects of personal health concerns and trust in healthcare providers on (a) the intention to create an EHR and (b) to share personal health-data. In the same vein, we do not find any significant effect of patients' privacy concerns on the intention to create an EHR and intention to share personal health-data. Furthermore, the patients' perceived benefits outweigh the perceived risks for EHR using. Conclusions This research provides a more holistic understanding of patients' privacy concerns. Particularly, we highlight the key role of personal health concerns and trust in healthcare providers with the intention to create an EHR and to share personal health data. Empirical evidence underlines the importance to involve all the stakeholders in the implementation process. Findings are discussed according to existing literature and practical guidelines are suggested to the health policymakers and healthcare providers.},

The existence of this data offers unprecedented opportunities for data analytics research in various domains of societal importance including medicine and public policy. The results of these analyses can be considered a public good which benefits data contributors as well as individuals who are not making their data available. At the same time, the release of personal information carries perceived and actual privacy risks to the contributors. Our research addresses this problem area. In our work, we study a game-theoretic model in which individuals take control over participation in data analytics projects in two ways: 1) individuals can contribute data at a self-chosen level of precision, and 2) individuals can decide whether they want to contribute at all (or not). From the analyst's perspective, we investigate to which degree the research analyst has flexibility to set requirements for data precision, so that individuals are still willing to contribute to the project, and the quality of the estimation improves. We study this tradeoff scenario for populations of homogeneous and heterogeneous individuals, and determine Nash equilibria that reflect the optimal level of participation and precision of contributions. We further prove that the analyst can substantially increase the accuracy of the analysis by imposing a lower bound on the precision of the data that users can reveal.}

This measure is often used uncritically to compare levels of trust across people and cultures even though those levels may be affected by people's attitudes to risk. We evaluate an incentive-compatible experiment designed to investigate the potential for a risk-trust confound using a sample of 202 students at the University of Cape Town in 2016. We depart from the earlier risk-trust literature by using a risk preference task that incorporates a wide range of prizes and probabilities. This allows us to investigate whether earlier ambiguous results concerning risk- trust interactions simply reflect weak measurement instruments, and facilitates the estimation of structural econometric risk preference models. We find that amounts sent in the trust game are indeed associated with attitudes to risk, that the magnitude of this relationship is economically significant, and that it is robust across statistical models. In addition, we find that most previous studies of the risk-trust confound use preference elicitation mechanisms that are underpowered for identifying risk-trust relationships. Our results caution against the widespread use of the trust game to measure and compare levels of trust without careful adjustments for risk attitudes.},

Hence, before decision-making, the players meet and sequentially talk. A player benevolently talks based on his limited information.

  abstract = {Trust and trustworthiness are of great importance in social and human systems, especially when considering managerial and economic decision-making. In this paper, we investigate the emergent dynamics of an evolutionary game-theoretic model - the \$\{N\}\$ -player evolutionary trust game - consisting of three types of players: 1) an investor; 2) a trustee who is trustworthy; and 3) a trustee who is untrustworthy. Here, we limit the interactions between players to local neighborhoods defined by a specific spatial topology or social network. Players are able to adjust their game-playing strategies using an evolutionary update rule based on the payoffs obtained by their neighbors. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we find that trust can be promoted when players interact on a social network despite a substantial number of untrustworthy individuals in the initial population. These results differ from findings reported for an unstructured population of the same game, where the existence of a single untrustworthy individual would eliminate trust completely. We compare the dynamics of the model with different social network densities and structures (e.g., from regular lattices to scale-free and random networks). We observe that the levels of trust vary under different network structures, and the level is correlated with how 'difficult' the game is. When game conditions are easy (i.e., low temptation to defect and/or almost no initial untrustworthy trustees), homogeneous networks with higher densities can promote higher levels of trust. However, when the game becomes harder, heterogeneous social networks with lower densities are able to promote higher levels of trust and global net wealth. \textcopyright{} 1997-2012 IEEE.},

Nevertheless, teachers play a vital role in shaping adolescents' online safety behavior and can impart the concepts of online safety to students through their interactions in daily life. Consequently, the motivations for teachers' risky online behavior warrant further investigation. The findings of prior studies involving online safety behavior based on protection motivation theory (PMT) have been mixed, which suggests the existence of moderating factors. The present study recruited 505 in-service teachers and examined the moderating roles of gender and social norms based on PMT using a multigroup analysis. We also conducted qualitative interviews to corroborate the results of the statistical analysis. The results indicate that to prevent teachers from engaging in risky online behavior, it is necessary \textendash{} but not sufficient \textendash{} to enhance teachers' skills in coping with online safety problems or to create a climate that encourages them to adopt protective measures.

Yet, current legislations are formed to identify personal data as a singular category regardless of the requirements, including the specification of processed personal data to be relevant and limited to what is necessary for enabling service functions. Without categorization, measuring ``relevant'' and ``necessary'' can be ambiguous. Several pieces of researches have explored the impact of personal information type and sensitivity level on privacy concern and disclosure; however, most of them lacked an in-depth examination of data categorization with systematic validation. Our study aims to fill this gap, and additionally further look into how contextual demographic factors influence the perception on information privacy concern and disclosure of different personal data categories from a Malaysian perspective. Our study provides new evidence of validated personal data categories and their significant differences in perceived information privacy concern and disclosure intention. Our research finding also discovers that Age, Gender, and Working Industry, as demographic factors, have significant effects on disclosure intention associated with Tracking, Finance, Authenticating, and Medical-health information. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The application of this culture-gene coevolutionary approach to understanding human social psychology has generated novel insights into the cognitive and affective foundations of large-scale cooperation, social norms and ethnicity. This approach hypothesizes a norm-psychology: a suite of psychological adaptations for inferring, encoding in memory, adhering to, enforcing and redressing violations of the shared behavioral standards of one's community. After reviewing the substantial body of formal theory underpinning these predictions, we outline how this account organizes diverse empirical findings in the cognitive sciences and related disciplines.

The CRT has a moderate positive correlation with measures of intelligence, such as the Intelligence Quotient test, and it correlates highly with various measures of mental heuristics.Later research showed that the CRT is a multifaceted construct: many start their response with the correct answer, while others fail to solve the test even if they reflect on their intuitive first answer. It has also been argued that suppression of the first answer is not the only factor behind the successful performance on the CRT: numeracy and reflectivity both account for performance.},

While bid price censoring has been recognized in the literature, previous research has not examined the specific dollar level at which bids should be censoredthe price at which a product can actually be purchased outside of the experimental auction or the price at which participants believe it can be purchased. We provide evidence from a field interview and experimental auction that individual-specific perceived prices differ from actual market prices.

Yet, there is surprisingly little empirical work documenting the patterns of interdependence that people experience in daily life. We use experience sampling to study how people think about 3 dimensions of interdependence in daily life and how these dimensions relate to cooperation. In Study 1, 139 romantic couples (n = 278) reported on situations experienced with their partner (k = 6,766); in Study 2, individuals (n = 284) reported on situations experienced with any other person (k = 7,248), over the course of 1 week. Across both samples, we found that most social interactions were perceived as containing moderate mutual dependence, equal power, and corresponding interests. When couples reported on the same situation (Study 1), they largely agreed on their experienced interdependence and cooperation, suggesting that their reports reflect an underlying shared reality. In daily interactions across both samples, higher mutual dependence and lower conflict of interests were associated with more cooperation, whereas relative power was not directly related to cooperation. These associations replicated in laboratory experiments (Study 2). In daily life, high mutual dependence and high relative power exacerbated the negative relation between conflict of interests and cooperation. Finally, prevalent patterns of interdependence and the experience of specific interdependent situations affected multiple relationship outcomes. Our findings stress the importance of studying a diverse array of interdependent situations\textemdash and especially situations with corresponding interests\textemdash to better understand cooperation in daily life.

Furthermore, the link between Honesty\textendash Humility and prosociality was neither conditional on objective interdependence nor on subjective perceptions of interdependence. Nonetheless, perceptions of conflict and power tracked objective properties of economic games and were related to prosocial behaviour in the lab and field.

Importantly, perceptions of interdependence are associated with prosocial behaviour. Perceived conflict of interests, in particular, is detrimental to prosociality, whereas mutual dependence can foster prosocial behaviour. Further, perceived conflict of interests and power may together shape cooperative outcomes.

However the experiments one chooses to conduct will be influenced by one's implicit or explicit philosophy of knowledge, particularly if this philosophy is taken as axiomatic rather than as an hypothesis. We argue that practical experience of knowledge engineering, particularly in the long term maintenance of expert systems, suggests that knowledge does not necessarily have a rigorous structure built up from primitive concepts and their relationships. The knowledge engineer finds that the expert's knowledge is not so much recalled, but to a greater or lesser degree ``made up'' by the expert as the occasion demands. The knowledge the expert provides varies with the context and gets its validity from its ability to explain data and justify the expert's judgement in the context. We argue that the physical symbol hypothesis with its implication that some underlying knowledge structure can be found is a misleading philosophical underpinning for knowledge acquisition and representation. We suggest that the ``insight'' hypothesis of Lonergan (1958) better explains the flexibility and relativity of knowledge that the knowledge engineer experiences and may provide a more suitable philosophical environment for developing knowledge acquisition and representation tools. We outline the features desirable in tools based on this philosophy and the progress we have made towards developing such tools.},

We introduce the computational construct of 'deontic value' - based on active inference and Markov decision processes - to formalize conceptions of social conformity and human decision-making. Deontic value is an attribute of choices, behaviors, or action sequences that inherit directly from deontic cues in our econiche (e.g., red traffic lights); namely, cues that denote an obligatory social rule. Crucially, the prosocial aspect of deontic value rests upon a particular form of circular causality: deontic cues exist in the environment in virtue of the environment being modified by repeated actions, while action itself is contingent upon the deontic value of environmental cues. We argue that this construction of deontic cues enables the epistemic (i.e., information-seeking) and pragmatic (i.e., goal- seeking) values of any behavior to be 'cached' or 'outsourced' to the environment, where the environment effectively 'learns' about the behavior of its denizens. We describe the process whereby this particular aspect of value enables learning of habitual behavior over neurodevelopmental and transgenerational timescales. \textcopyright{} 2019 Constant, Ramstead, Veissi\`ere and Friston.},

Studies conducted in the upper limb demonstrated that sense of effort is also an important source of kinaesthetic information. Objectives: To better understand proprioceptive deficits in people with chronic LBP (cLBP), this study aimed to test whether sense of effort is affected in people with cLBP. Design: Cross-sectional study. Method: Fourteen participants with cLBP and fourteen healthy participants performed a 120~s force matching task with their trunk extensor muscles at a low intensity. Results: When visual feedback of the generated force was provided, both groups performed the task accurately. Removal of visual feedback resulted in an increase in error for both groups (p~{$<~$}0.0001), but the increase in error was significantly larger for the cLBP group (p~=~0.023). This larger error could be attributed to undershooting of the target force (p~=~0.020). The control group did not consistently undershoot or overshoot the target force (p~=~0.93). Furthermore, the amount of undershooting for the cLBP group increased as the task progressed (p~=~0.016), which was not observed for the control group (p~=~0.80). Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that sense of effort is affected in cLBP. People with cLBP overestimated the trunk extension force they generated, and the error increased as the trial progressed. With visual feedback however, people with cLBP were able to compensate and perform the task as accurately as people without cLBP.},

  abstract = {Robots are currently being developed to enter our lives and interact with us in different tasks. For humans to be able to have a positive experience of interaction with such robots, they need to trust them to some degree. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a social robot that was created to play a card game with humans, playing the role of a partner and opponent. This type of activity is especially important, since our target group is elderly people - a population that often suffers from social isolation. Moreover, the card game scenario can lead to the development of interesting trust dynamics during the interaction, in which the human that partners with the robot needs to trust it in order to succeed and win the game. The design of the robot's behavior and game dynamics was inspired in previous user-centered design studies in which elderly people played the same game. Our evaluation results show that the levels of trust differ according to the previous knowledge that players have of their partners. Thus, humans seem to significantly increase their trust level towards a robot they already know, whilst maintaining the same level of trust in a human that they also previously knew. Henceforth, this paper shows that trust is a multifaceted construct that develops differently for humans and robots.},

Three experiments on design approaches were added to the survey application. One experiment varied whether respondents were reminded of their progress through the instrument. In a second experiment, one version presented several related items on one screen, while the other version presented one question per screen. In a third experiment, for one series of questions a random half of the sample clicked radio buttons to indicate their answers, while the other half entered a numeric response in a box. This article discusses the overall implementation and outcome of the survey, and it describes the results of the imbedded design experiments.}

Individuals show systematic, personality dependent differences in their privacy decision making, which makes it interesting for those who seek to design `nudges' designed to manipulate privacy behaviors. We explore such effects in a cookie decision task. Two hundred and ninety participants were given an incidental website review task that masked the true aim of the study. At the task outset, they were asked whether they wanted to accept a cookie in a message that either contained a social framing `nudge' (they were told that either a majority or a minority of users like themselves had accepted the cookie) or contained no information about social norms (control). At the end of the task, participants were asked to complete a range of personality assessments (impulsivity, risk-taking, willingness to self-disclose and sociability). We found social framing to be an effective behavioral nudge, reducing cookie acceptance in the minority social norm condition. Further, we found personality effects in that those scoring highly on risk-taking and impulsivity were significantly more likely to accept the cookie. Finally, we found that the application of a social nudge could attenuate the personality effects of impulsivity and risk-taking. We explore the implications for those working in the privacy-by-design space.},

Less attention has been given to scenarios in which human-machine cooperation is beneficial but non-trivial, such as scenarios in which human and machine preferences are neither fully aligned nor fully in conflict. Cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but instead is facilitated by intuition, cultural norms, emotions, signals, and pre-evolved dispositions. Here, we develop an algorithm that combines a state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning algorithm~with mechanisms for signaling. We show that this algorithm can cooperate with people and other algorithms at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. These results indicate that general human-machine cooperation is achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of algorithmic mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Within western societies the act of consumption is not merely concerned with satisfying basic human needs. Rather, consumption has become a source of leisure and self expression for the masses (Belk, 1988). This has meant that humankind's wants have tended to outstrip the world's finite resources available, leading to environmental damage, questionable farming practice and the widespread abuse of human labour. In response to these issues the phenomena of ethical consumption was born. Ethical consumption attempts to limit the environmental, human and animal costs of our spending via the favouring of products that are deemed to be for the betterment of wider society. At face value ethical consumption has been hugely successful in terms of market share, with sales of products stressing their ethical credentials having grown rapidly in recent years (Cooperative Bank 2011). However, despite this success, ethically branded products still represent a minority of purchases (Th\o gersen, 2006).     Psychological research exploring the reasons why consumers purchase ethically is dominated by papers focusing upon consumers' attitudes, values and intentions (Andorfer \& Liebe, 2012, Milfont \& Duckitt, 2004). However, consumers' attitudes do not always mirror actual spending (Auger, Burke, Devinney \& Louviere., 2003; Auger \& Devinney, 2007). Whilst one third of consumers describe themselves as being ethical spenders, only 1-3\% of products purchased are Fair Trade certified (Cowe \& Williams, 2000). The divergence between attitude and behaviour has been referred to as the `ethical purchasing gap' (Andorfer \& Liebe, 2012, Clayton \& Brook, 2005). One factor that may be partially responsible for the divergence between purchase intention and actual behaviours is self-regulatory fatigue (ego depletion).     Chapter one of the thesis presents the argument for ethical spending being affected by, amongst other things, our ability to suppress our impulsive desires via a process known as self-regulation (Bagozzi, 1992; Baumeister, 2002; Baumeister \& Vohs, 2007). According to the self-regulatory fatigue literature, self-control requires the expenditure of blood glucose (Gailliot, 2008, Inzlicht \& Gutsell, 2007). However, the available level of blood glucose temporarily diminishes with continued use of the self-regulatory system.    In response to the lower availability of blood glucose, individuals begin to limit all non-essential cognitive expenditure, including further acts of self-regulation. Individuals who have exhausted their capacity for self control are said to be ego depleted or in a state of self-regulatory fatigue (Baumeister \& Heatherton, 1996; Hofmann. Friese \& Strack, 2009; Muraven \& Baumeister, 2000) Chapter one argues that self-regulatory fatigue may restrict an individual's capacity to consider the social and long-term impacts of their spending to resist the temptation of cheap consumer goods. As a result, it is predicted that ethical spending may be negatively affected by self-regulation fatigue. Following this theoretical foundation, Chapter two presents the methodological rationale for the research project that set out to test various aspects of this foundational hypothesis.     Chapter three presents the findings of the first empirical study. The purpose of the study was to use open-ended questionnaires to explore the principles that guided participants' spending, as well gaining an insight into instances where there was a discrepancy between spending and principle. The study is included within the thesis primarily to show the genesis of the research agenda. The study indicated that consumers within the sample were primarily concerned with traditional forms of ethical consumption, namely environmental, human and animal welfare concerns. Participants justified non-principled purchasing as being a result of financial consideration or impulsive urge. It was thus decided to explore the possibility that self-regulation fatigue may have a potentially negative impact upon ethical spending, due to its known relationship with impulsive spending (Vohs \& Faber, 2007).    Chapter four explores the effects of self-regulation fatigue upon socially-minded economic behaviour within the controlled setting of a social dilemma game. Ethical consumption can be considered to be a prime example of a `social dilemma' in the sense that decisions relating to whether or not to consume ethically involve a direct conflict between an individual's short term interests (e.g. to save money) and the collective interests of wider society (Gattig \& Hendrickx, 2007; Milfont \& Gouveiac, 2006). Therefore it was decided to measure the effects of self-regulatory fatigue within an experimental social dilemma task. The task used was based upon the forest game, which was first outlined by Sheldon and McGregor (2000), with the white bear thought suppression task (Wegner, Schneider, Carter, \& White, 1987) being utilised to manipulate self-regulatory fatigue. The results revealed a clear divergence in behaviour within the game as a function of the manipulation of self-regulatory fatigue, with non-depleted groups sustaining the central resource longer than their depleted counterparts.    Chapter five builds on the findings of chapter four through an exploration of the relationship between ego depletion and participants' willingness to pay for ethical goods. The study utilised a discrete choice measure in order to measure participant's willingness to pay for ethical goods. The findings did not show a significant effect of self-regulatory fatigue on the willingness to pay for ethical goods. However a potential explanation for this result was the fact that the decision-making processes involved in this study were less arduous than those required within a real-life shopping environment (or, for that matter, than the decisions required in the forest game reported in chapter four). It is possible that the complexity of the choice presented may have been insufficient for the decision to be negatively affected by self-regulatory fatigue. The study is thus included in order to illustrate the importance of utilising more realistic measures of spending that incorporate more of the complexity of decision-making required in real-world contexts.      Chapter six presents four separate experiments exploring the relationship between self-regulatory fatigue and ethical spending. The first study utilised an online supermarket simulation and asked participants to go shopping for one week's worth of groceries after either completing, or not completing, the white bear thought suppression task. The simulated supermarket allowed participants to select from a range of over 1900 products. The pattern of results indicated that participants in a state of self-regulatory fatigue spent significantly less on ethically branded products than their non-depleted counterparts. However, this was only true for individuals with a high food budget. Those with a low budget were not significantly affected, presumably due to having relatively little flexibility in terms of product choice and/or having established shopping habits focusing upon value.       The second study in chapter six explored the ways in which social appeals interact with self-regulatory fatigue. Participants were presented with an attention control task before reading either an article praising students for their ethical behaviours or a control article. Participants were then asked to ``go shopping'' within the online store. Results once again indicated that self-regulatory fatigue reduced spending on ethically branded goods. However, contrary to predictions, the social appeal had no significant effect on levels of ethical spending either as a main effect or in interaction with self-regulatory fatigue. The study also explored the effect that self-regulatory fatigue had upon the relationship between behavioural intentions and subsequent ethical spending behaviour. The findings revealed that behavioural intention was shown to predict ethical spending only at times when self-regulatory fatigue was low. When self-regulatory fatigue was high, the frequency of previous ethical purchasing was shown to be a more important determinant of ethical spending than behavioural intention.    The third study further investigated the influence of self-regulatory fatigue on ethical spending by comparing the effects of an article stressing the fact that engaging in ethical spending would bring social approval with an article stressing that ethical spending was an individual's personal responsibility. Chapter six sets out the argument that since personal norms are internalized appealing to an individual's sense of personal responsibility, they may have a relatively automatic influence upon individual's behaviour. In contrast, social approval may have less influence under the influence of ego depletion as it requires the consideration of others points of view (Moore and Loewenstein, 2004). The analysis revealed a marginally significant interaction between self-regulation fatigue and article type in relation to rates of ethical spending. At times of high self-regulatory fatigue, stressing personal responsibility appeared to be more effective in increasing ethical spending than stressing social approval.     The final empirical study in the thesis aimed to explore the impact of self-regulatory fatigue on ethical purchasing in a real-world context by comparing shopping receipts with self-reported levels of self-regulatory and mental fatigue during actual supermarket shopping trips. The results indicated that self-regulatory and mental fatigue did indeed have a negative impact upon ethical spending and this effect was detectable even in the face of the increased background noise that is associated with taking such measures in a naturalistic context rather than in the lab.     The final chapter of the thesis integrates all of these empirical results and considers their potential implications, limitations and the directions that they offer for future research. The thesis concludes that under the specific circumstances, where consumers have some discretion over their spending, self-regulatory fatigue has a negative effect upon consumers' rates of ethical spending. The findings suggest that to fully understand ethical spending researchers are required to consider the economic, habitual and social psychological factors (such as attitudes and levels of self-regulatory fatigue) that may be involved. However, the relationship between self-regulation and ethical behaviour, identified for the first time in the current research, represents an exciting finding and a potential building block for future research in this area.},

  abstract = {Risk management is a problem humans have faced throughout history and across societies. One way to manage risk is to transfer it to other parties through formal and informal insurance systems. One informal method of self-insurance is limited risk pooling, where individuals can ask for help only when in need. Models suggest that need-based transfer systems may require coordination and common knowledge to be effective. To explore the impact of common knowledge on social coordination and risk pooling in volatile environments, we designed and ran a Risk Pooling Game. We compared participants who played the game with no advance priming or framing to participants who read one of two texts describing real-world systems of risk pooling. Players in the primed games engaged in more repetitive asking and repetitive giving than those in the control games. Players in the primed games also gave more in response to requests and were more likely to respond positively to requests than players in the control games. In addition, players in the primed games were more tolerant of wide differences between what the two players gave and received. These results suggest that the priming texts led players to pay less attention to debt and repayment and more attention to the survival of the other player, and thus to more risk pooling. These results are consistent with findings from fieldwork in small-scale societies that suggest that humans use need-based transfer systems to pool risk when environmental volatility leads to needs with unpredictable timing. Models suggest that the need-based transfer strategy observed in this experiment can outperform debt-based strategies. The results of the present study suggest that the suite of behaviors associated with need-based transfers is an easily triggered part of the human behavioral repertoire.},

Group information sharing and decision-making effectiveness were found to be higher in small groups with a low percentage of shared information, and lower when groups either were large or shared a high percentage of information (N = 80 groups). Greater information sharing, however, did not correlate with longer discussions. The proportion of shared information affected bolstering and discounting of information. Qualitative observations of group behavior are presented, and the implications of the results for information sharing and decision making are discussed.},

This study addresses what differentiates consumers who object to certain uses of personal information from those who do not object. Data collected by questionnaire from young consumers are used to identify a research approach for investigating attitudes toward the secondary use of personal information for direct marketing. Secondary information use occurs when personal information collected for one purpose is subsequently used for a different purpose. While secondary information use is both widespread and legal, it may be viewed as an invasion of privacy when it occurs without the knowledge or consent of the consumer. The setting for the study is the use of point-of-sale data from a supermarket frequent shopper program to generate direct mail solicitations.    Control emerges as a clear theme in differentiating individuals with positive overall attitudes toward secondary information use from those with negative attitudes. Study participants with positive attitudes are less concerned about privacy (measured as control over personal information), perceive shopping by mail as beneficial, and have coping strategies for dealing with unwanted mail. The results also suggest that theory related to categorization of strategic issues as positive-negative with outcomes that are controllable/uncontrollable provides a basis for understanding differences in the ways individuals perceive practices involving personal information. Future research should focus on the specific characteristics of secondary use practices, including the sensitivity of the information, its source, its perceived relevance to the original transaction, and whether disclosure reflects informed consent or results in a potentially harmful outcome to the individual},

We apply our framework to studying interdependent and competitive synchronization in multi-layer oscillator networks and cooperative/competitive contagions in an epidemic model. Using a mean-field theory which we verify numerically, we find explosive transitions and rich behavior which is absent in percolation models including hysteresis, multi-stability and chaos. The framework presented here provides a powerful new way to model and understand many of the interacting complex systems which surround us.},

  abstract = {Complex decision-making in organizations is a process frequently assigned to teams. An expected benefit of utilizing teams is that, due to an expanded pool of available information, outcomes may be superior to those of an individual decision-maker. However, research using the Hidden-Profile Paradigm (i.e., a research design where each team member has information that must be shared to arrive at an accurate solution) has consistently shown that team members regularly fail to exploit their unique information to produce accurate decisions. This failure may be due to a combination of social, individual, and contextual factors, information processing inaccuracies, and cognitive biases. The current study sought to determine whether individuals' perception of competence relative to other team members influences information sharing and decision accuracy in hidden-profiles. Further, the interactive effects of competitive versus cooperative environmental factors were examined. Two-person teams were assembled to solve a hidden-profile task. Team members were led to believe that they were either more or less competent than their team-mate, and instructed to either cooperate or compete with one another. Results indicated that teams comprising individuals who perceived themselves as relatively less competent shared more information; however, decision accuracy was found to be better only under a cooperative environment. In addition, intention to strategically withhold information from one's team-mate was found to be higher for teams under a competitive environment. The study has implications for hidden-profile research and for team decision-making in organizations.},

We also examine whether advanced disclosure of the choice tasks impacts on the probability of exhibiting ordering effects of those different types. We analyze our data both non-parametrically and parametrically and find robust evidence for ordering effects. We also find that the patterns of order effect in respondents' preferences are significantly changed but not eradicated by the advanced disclosure of choice tasks a finding that offers insights into the choice behaviors underpinning order effects.},

Privacy externalities are the negative by-product of the services offered by some data controllers, whereby the price to `pay' for a service includes not just the provision of the user's own personal data, but also that of others. This term, related to similar concepts from the literature on privacy such as `networked privacy' or `data pollution', is used here to bring to light the incentives and exploitative dynamics behind a phenomenon which, I demonstrate, benefits both the user and the data controller to the detriment of third-party data subjects. Building on these novel elements and on the relevant concepts and examples found in the existing literature, this article draws a comprehensive picture of the phenomenon, and offers two promising paths to address it\textemdash better enforcing the principle of data protection by design and by default, and relying on the framework of joint controllership. \textcopyright{} 2020, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

The Ultimatum Game is one such exchange which is assumed to measure preferences for ``fairness.'' The current experiment tests if cueing interdependence triggers an exchange heuristic prompting proposers to give more equal offers, and responders to reject more unequal offers from a particular (yet anonymous) partner. Contrary to expectations, interdependence did not affect proposer behavior, while it spurred responders to be more rational. Responders who were told that they would be matched with one of the other participants after making their decision, rejected an unequal offer more frequently than those who were told they had already been matched prior to making the decision, and for whom the interdependent nature of the exchange was made salient. Based on post-experimental questionnaire data, a plausible explanation for the observed result is that unmatched responders, fostering the illusion of control, reject more in order to signal that they are tough bargainers.},

Here we examine whether intergroup competition amplifies or mitigates effects of individual versus team reward on information sharing biases and group decision quality. Individuals (N = 309) in 103 interacting groups were given private information on four decision alternatives and discussed a joint decision. Private information was distributed such that groups faced a ``hidden profile'' in which pushing for initial preferences and commonly held information prohibits the group from finding the best alternative. Group members were rewarded for team or individual performance, and groups faced intergroup competition or not. Whereas intergroup competition did not influence common-information bias, we find that when intergroup competition is absent, groups under individual (versus team) reward have stronger preference-consistency bias and make poorer decisions. When intergroup competition is present, however, groups under individual reward perform as good as groups under team reward. Results resonate with the possibility that intergroup competition overshadows within-group rivalry, and can promote even-handed discussions within small groups of decision-makers. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

Formal analyses generate predictions about effort expended on revising and protecting the status quo, the form and function of false signalling and cheap talk, how power differences impact conflict intensity and the likelihood of status quo revision. Laboratory experiments on the neurocognitive and hormonal foundations of attack and defence reveal that out-of-equilibrium investments in attack emerge because of non-selfish preferences, limited capacity to compute costs and benefits and optimistic beliefs about the chances of winning from one's rival. We conclude with implications for the likelihood of political change and inertia, and discuss the role of ideology in political games of attack and defence., This article is part of the theme issue `The political brain: neurocognitive and computational mechanisms'.},

Negotiators with an individualistic social value orientation do not discriminate in their choice between cooperative and competitive heuristics. Study 2 shows that following preparation, prosocial negotiators recall more cooperative than competitive heuristics while individualists and competitors do the reverse. Additional measures suggest that prosocial negotiators prefer cooperative heuristics because these are seen as morally appropriate, whereas individualists and competitors prefer competitive heuristics because these are seen as effective.

It starts with typical social choice themes like Arrow's Theorem and ends with typical game theoretical topics, like bargaining and interval games. In between there is a mixture of views on collective decision making in which both social choice and game theoretic aspects are brought in.

We connect normative theories of charitability (captured in Maimonides' Ladder of Charity) with evolutionary theories of partner choice to test predictions on how attributions of charitability are affected by states of knowledge: whether the identity of the donor or of the beneficiary is revealed to the other. Consistent with the theories, in Experiments 1\textendash 2 participants judged a double-blind gift as more charitable than one to a revealed beneficiary, which in turn was judged as more charitable than one from a revealed donor. We also found one exception: Participants judged a donor who revealed only himself as slightly less, rather than more, charitable than one who revealed both identities. Experiment 3 explains the exception as a reaction to the donor's perceived sense of superiority and disinterest in a social relationship. Experiment 4 found that donors were judged as more charitable when the gift was shared knowledge (each aware of the other's identity, but unsure of the other's awareness) than when it was common knowledge (awareness of awareness). Experiment 5, which titrated anonymity against donation size, found that not even a hundredfold larger gift could compensate for the disapproval elicited by a donor revealing his identity. Experiment 6 showed that participants' judgments of charitability flip depending on whose perspective they take: Observers disapprove of donations that they would prefer as beneficiaries. Together, these experiments provide insight into why people care about how a donor gives, not just how much.},

  abstract = {Purpose Experimental auctions are widely used as a non-hypothetical value elicitation method to examine consumer preferences for novel, controversial foods. However, despite its advantages over hypothetical methods, its practice might lead to a wide variety of biases. The purpose of this paper is to provide a list of key cognitive biases and design effects in food auction research and to deliver scientifically underpinned procedures in order to assess, control and reduce them. Its applicability and relevance is examined in auctions on willingness-to-pay for folate (GM) biofortified rice. Design/methodology/approach Based on auction literature, a list of 18 biases has been developed. Experimental auctions were conducted with 252 women from Shanxi Province, China to test the occurrence of eight biases, while demonstrating measures to reduce the risk of ten biases. Findings The results lend support for three information-related effects, i.e. confirmation bias, conflicting product information effects and a primacy bias, but not for a multiple-good valuation effect, a panel size effect, a trial winner effect and time-related sampling biases. Furthermore, there are no clear indications of social desirability bias, auction fever and a false consensus effect. Research limitations/implications This study emphasizes the need to take into account, and measure the risk of various biases when developing, organizing and interpreting experimental auctions. Future research should further extend the list of biases and validate the study findings. Originality/value By using a highly topical subject, this study is one of the first to address the potential risk of cognitive biases and design effects in experimental (food) auctions.},

We explored the extent to which Dark Triad traits (sub-clinical psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism) support a selfish behavioral strategy. We related performance on a hypothetical Prisoner's Dilemma (an economic game that simulates a two-person social dilemma) to participants' (N = 1400) Dark Triad scores. Because contextual factors also impact selfish behaviors, we tested how framing (gain vs. loss; and social vs. nonsocial) shaped performance in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Participants with high Dark Triad scores were more likely to behave selfishly in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Participants were also most likely to betray their partner in loss-framed and non-socially framed contexts. These effects did not interact with Dark Triad scores. Our data are consistent with the view that seemingly negative personality traits (like those associated with the Dark Triad traits) that persist in the population may serve as evolutionarily adaptive behavioral strategies. \textcopyright{} 2018 Deutchman, Sullivan.

Thus, this study used a U.S. representative sample to test the privacy calculus' generalizability and extend its theoretical framework by including both self-withdrawal behaviors and privacy self-efficacy. Results confirmed the extended privacy calculus model. Moreover, both privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy positively predicted use of self-withdrawal.

  abstract = {Differential privacy is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset. The idea behind differential privacy is that if the effect of making an arbitrary single substitution in the database is small enough, the query result cannot be used to infer much about any single individual, and therefore provides privacy. Another way to describe differential privacy is as a constraint on the algorithms used to publish aggregate information about a statistical database which limits the disclosure of private information of records whose information is in the database. For example, differentially private algorithms are used by some government agencies to publish demographic information or other statistical aggregates while ensuring confidentiality of survey responses, and by companies to collect information about user behavior while controlling what is visible even to internal analysts. Roughly, an algorithm is differentially private if an observer seeing its output cannot tell if a particular individual's information was used in the computation.  Differential privacy is often discussed in the context of identifying individuals whose information may be in a database. Although it does not directly refer to identification and reidentification attacks, differentially private algorithms probably resist such attacks.Differential privacy was developed by cryptographers and thus is often associated with cryptography, and draws much of its language from cryptography.},

Important advances have been made in uncovering the neurobiological underpinnings of key factors involved in cooperation and coordination, including social preferences, cooperative beliefs, (emotion) signaling, and, in particular, reputations and (in)direct reciprocity. Emerging trends at the cross-sections of psychology, economics, and the neurosciences include an increased focus on group heterogeneities, intergroup polarization and conflict, cross-cultural differences in cooperation and norm enforcement, and neurocomputational modeling of the formation and updating of social preferences and beliefs.

One purpose of the experiments was to determine whether reversing the order of the presentation of response options resulted in order effects, including primacy and anchoring A second purpose was to determine the effects of converting check-allthat-apply questions to a forced choice-format (e.g. Yes/No for each item). We found that the existence of order effects in check-all-that-apply questions appears to depend on whether questions require respondents to use temporarily or chronically accessible information, as has been previously reported for items requiring selection of only one response option. The conversion to a forced/choice format increased the percentage of respondents answering affirmatively to each response option. Additionally, forced-choice formatted questions were unaffected by the use of more active answer categories (e.g. fan/not a fan) as opposed to the common yes/no format. Finally, the results from this survey of a random sample of 1503 University students, were quite similar to results from a previous mail survey experiment, suggesting that the response patterns observed in the current experiment result from selfadministration in general, and not from a unique characteristic of web surveys.},

A theoretical model that incorporated contrary factors representing elements of a privacy calculus was tested using data gathered from 369 respondents. Structural equations modeling (SEM) using LISREL validated the instrument and the proposed model. The results suggest that although Internet privacy concerns inhibit e-commerce transactions, the cumulative influence of Internet trust and personal Internet interest are important factors that can outweigh privacy risk perceptions in the decision to disclose personal information when an individual uses the Internet.

Our aim is to understand the importance of fairness on subjects' decision making process in some specific contexts. For that purpose, in this dissertation we review literature trying to find evidence of fairness motivations on subjects, and we decide to focus our attention on three groups of experiments, concretely bargaining, public goods and market experiments. As regards bargaining experiments, both in the ultimatum game and the dictator game subjects offer positive and significantly high shares of the available amount, around 30\%-40\% and 20\%-30\% respectively, even though in the dictator game proposals cannot be rejected. Subjects do not only care about their own payoff and situation, but also about their peers. In this sense, property rights are crucial for explaining subjects' decision making. In the case of public goods experiments, positive and substantial contributions to the public good are observed, which are on average between 40\%-60\% of the total endowment. However, repetition leads to a gradual reduction on contributions, which is clearly cut by introducing a punishment option, even if this is costly for subjects. As for market experiments, employers offer wages well above the market-clearing level and workers respond with high effort levels. Nonetheless, the way effort is determined (endogenously or exogenously) strongly affects fairness enforcement decisions on subjects.},

  abstract = {Personal user data has proven extremely valuable for firms in the digital age. The wealth of data available to firms has provided unprecedented access into the world of the consumer. Companies hoping to capitalize on their user's data have turned to several interesting outlets. This research addresses the repurposing of user data as content in marketing. By analyzing four cases of data presented as marketing communications across two companies, this research provides new insights into the public release of private user data for marketing purposes. Four cases of personal data used in marketing communications were chosen specifically for their time proximity, characteristics of the sending firms, and their disparate outcomes. These instances of marketing communications, two by Spotify and two by Netflix, were released during November and December of 2017 and each resulted in a diverse range of public opinion. An analysis of these cases was conducted using the comprehensive framework of integrated marketing communications (Tafesse \& Kitchen, 2017). There is a significant difference in the perceptual outcomes of integrated marketing communication campaigns which display user data as content. This analysis provides insights into the characteristics of marketing communications and how their outcomes fit into broader marketing strategies. These case studies provide opportunities for marketers to improve their campaigns in line with their desired audience outcome. Patterns of scope, strategy, mode, and outcome do not suggest success or failure in the context of marketing communications, but rather a set of insights marketers should keep in mind when pursuing communication strategies which harness personal user data.},

Laboratory experiments have found that people gossip about others' cooperativeness and that they use gossip to condition their cooperation. Here, we move beyond the laboratory and test several predictions from theories of indirect reciprocity and reputation-based partner selection about the content of everyday gossip and how people use it to update the reputation of others in their social network. In a Dutch community sample (N = 309), we sampled daily events in which people either sent or received gossip about a target over 10 days (n gossip = 5284). Gossip senders frequently shared information about targets' cooperativeness and did so in ways that minimize potential retaliation from targets. Receivers overwhelmingly believed gossip to be true and updated their evaluation of targets based on gossip. In turn, a positive shift in the evaluation of a target was associated with higher intentions to help them in future interactions, and with lower intentions to avoid them in the future. Thus, gossip is used in daily life to impact and update reputations in a way that enables partner selection and indirect reciprocity.

Although gossip research has recently increased across the social sciences, gossip is conceptualized in disparate ways in the scientific literature. This conceptual confusion impedes theoretical integration and providing practical advice. To resolve this, we systematically reviewed 6114 scientific articles on gossip and identified 324 articles that define gossip. From these definitions, we extracted two essential characteristics of gossip on which there seems to be agreement within the literature, namely, (1) that gossip is communication between humans involving a sender, a receiver, and a target, and (2) that the target is absent or unaware of the communicated content. These two characteristics formed the basis of a broad, integrative definition of gossip: a sender communicating to a receiver about a target who is absent or unaware of the content. Furthermore, some definitions include characteristics on which there is less agreement: gossip valence (from negative to neutral to positive) and formality (from informal to intermediate to formal). We incorporate these characteristics in a dimensional scaling framework that can guide future research. Our broad, integrative definition of gossip and the dimensional scaling framework provide the building blocks for a systematic, integrated knowledge base on the role of gossip in human social life in general as well as in organizations. This can foster future theory development and hypothesis testing, ultimately helping organizations to manage gossip.},

Of critical importance to organizations such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and state and county offices of emergency management, we find that firms are willing to pay for external resilience information when they operate in information-poor environments. We also find that when firms purchase resilience information, they are less susceptible to the decision-making bias known as the gambler's fallacy, which has been shown to adversely affect firms operating in repeated disaster environments. This paper is one of the first of its kind to conduct experimental analysis on a national subject population of CEOs and COOs in the context of resilience. The results inform resilience planning efforts for public- and private-sector firms and organizations, with broad implications for the use of informational policy instruments to build economic resilience.},

Two models of confidence computation have been proposed: post hoc computation using post-decision variables and heuristics, versus online computation using continuous assessment of evidence throughout the decision-making process. Here, we arbitrate between these theories by continuously monitoring finger movements during a manual sequential decision-making task. Analysis of finger kinematics indicated that subjects kept separate online records of evidence and confidence: finger deviation continuously reflected the ongoing accumulation of evidence, whereas finger speed continuously reflected the momentary degree of confidence. Furthermore, end-of-trial finger speed predicted the post-decisional subjective confidence rating. These data indicate that confidence is computed on-line, throughout the decision process. Speed-confidence correlations were previously interpreted as a post-decision heuristics, whereby slow decisions decrease subjective confidence, but our results suggest an adaptive mechanism that involves the opposite causality: by slowing down when unconfident, participants gain time to improve their decisions.},

This belief is typically unobservable. In one of our experimental treatments we elicit these subjective beliefs using a proper scoring rule that induces truthful revelation of beliefs. This allows us to directly test the pivotal voter model. We find that a higher subjective probability of being pivotal increases the likelihood that an individual votes, but the probability thresholds used by subjects are not as crisp as the theory would predict. There is some evidence that individuals learn over time to adjust their beliefs to be more consistent with the historical frequency of pivotality. However, many subjects keep substantially overestimating their probability of being pivotal.},

After a brief introduction to the theory of dynamical systems, we focus on the common assumption in theoretical and computational neuroscience that phenomena at subcellular, cellular, network, cognitive, and even societal levels could be described and explained in terms of dynamical systems theory. As such, dynamical systems theory may also provide a framework for understanding mental illnesses. The review examines a number of core dynamical systems phenomena and relates each of these to aspects of mental illnesses. This provides an outline of how a broad set of phenomena in serious and common mental illnesses and neurological conditions can be understood in dynamical systems terms. It suggests that the dynamical systems level may provide a central, hublike level of convergence that unifies and links multiple biophysical and behavioral phenomena in the sense that diverse biophysical changes can give rise to the same dynamical phenomena and, vice versa, similar changes in dynamics may yield different behavioral symptoms depending on the brain area where these changes manifest. We also briefly outline current methodological approaches for inferring dynamical systems from data such as electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, or self-reports, and we discuss the implications of a dynamical view for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of psychiatric conditions. We argue that a consideration of dynamics could play a potentially transformative role in the choice and target of interventions.},

  abstract = {The problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history spanning multiple disciplines. As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition. After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations - not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed. We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses. Differential privacy in other models, including distributed databases and computations on data streams is discussed. Finally, we note that this work is meant as a thorough introduction to the problems and techniques of differential privacy, but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey- there is by now a vast amount of work in differential privacy, and we can cover only a small portion of it. \textcopyright{} 2014 C.

We identify the effects of responsibility on leaders' choices at the behavioral and neurobiological levels and document the widespread existence of responsibility aversion, that is, a reduced willingness to make decisions if the welfare of others is at stake. In mechanistic terms, basic preferences toward risk, loss, and ambiguity do not explain responsibility aversion, which, instead, is driven by a second-order cognitive process reflecting an increased demand for certainty about the best choice when others' welfare is affected. Finally, models estimating levels of information flow between brain regions that process separate choice components provide the first step in understanding the neurobiological basis of individual variability in responsibility aversion and leadership scores.},

  abstract = {A large-scale model using GPGPU and a face-to-face experiment using IoT devices are implemented, focusing on the effects of the information flow about strategies in both cases, to further consider the continuous social dynamics under more extreme conditions extended from the SPS model. Online social networks make our social interactions continuous in two senses: The first being temporal, as we stay constantly connected in real-time in a non-discrete way using our hand-held devices, and the second being the degree of social closeness as we use various Social Networking Services (SNSs) and communicate with others at different frequencies. Contrarily, many studies highlighted the importance of face-to-face interactions, and developed new approaches for the study of close-proximity networks (Eagle and Pentland, 2006). The issues of COVID-19 also imply that human face-to-face interactions are essential even at the age of SNS (Ozili and Arun, 2020). We have been investigating the continuous social dynamics using both a conceptual framework of social particle swarm (SPS) (Nishimoto et al., 2013), and anonymous web-based experiments with human subjects (Suzuki et al., 2018). It is still unclear however whether and how such cooperative relationships emerge in a large-scale or in face-toface networks as mentioned above. Our purpose is to further consider the continuous social dynamics under more extreme conditions extended from the SPS model; we implement a large-scale model using GPGPU (Elhamer et al., 2020a) and a face-to-face experiment using IoT devices (Elhamer et al., 2020b). In this paper, we briefly introduce both approaches, focusing on the effects of the information flow about strategies in both cases. Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of our approach.}

  abstract = {The purpose is to construct and analyze a large-scale 3D simulation of continuous social dynamics using an extended SPS model on parallel architecture and use a 3D space as a minimal approximation of a complex of social relationships that have much larger dimensions and comprise many channels of interaction, keeping sufficient spatial locality even when there is a large number of agents. Cooperative relationships are important to maintain high adaptivity in our societies while their structures undergo constant change. The development of information technology made a great impact on our lives and the way we interact; Social Networking Services brought about high continuity in our social interactions in two senses: One is temporal continuity by keeping us constantly connected in time in a non-discrete way, as well as in parallel; through hand-held devices for example, numerous people interact within an extended time frame and mostly are connected at the same time. The second is continuity in the closeness of social relationships. We use various kinds of SNS with different topologies of interactions and communicate with others at different frequencies, which presents continuous variations in the degree of social closeness with others. In addition, the exponential expansion of these networks in the world and consequently, the scale of interactions is another indicator of the major effect of these networks on our social relationships, allowing for larger-scale communication by alleviating the physical boundaries and increasing the rate of interactions over the globe. Based on the concept of self-driven particle models, Nishimoto et al. constructed a simple computational model for investigating such continuously changing social relationships termed social particle swarm (SPS) model (Nishimoto et al., 2013). They assumed that individuals were in a twodimensional social or psychological space, and the proximity between two individuals reflects their social or psychological closeness. Interactions between individuals in the space is regarded as changes in social or psychological relationships based on game-theoretical relationship (e.g., prisoners dilemma) between strategies of individuals. Each particle has a strategy for the prisoners dilemma game, and gets closer to (away from) neighbors from which each particle obtains positive (negative) payoffs. They observed repeated occurrences of explosive dynamics that consisted of a formation of an altruistic cluster followed by its collapse with explosive dispersal of defective particles. The similar dynamics were observed both computationally and experimentally (see (Suzuki et al., 2018)). However, it is still not clear whether and how the significant increase in the scale of social networks, as discussed above, can bring about more diversity and demonstrate emerging patterns for higher-level interactions. Such hierarchical structures and interactions between communities are ubiquitous in real societies, and we expect that larger population sizes enable us to see novel emerging patterns both structural and behavioral. Our purpose is to construct and analyze a large-scale 3D simulation of continuous social dynamics using an extended SPS model on parallel architecture. We use a 3D space as a minimal approximation of a complex of social relationships that have much larger dimensions and comprise many channels of interaction, keeping sufficient spatial locality even when there is a large number of agents. Due to the demanding computational power of large multi-agent systems' simulations, parallel architecture as a simulation platform best fits our goal.

  abstract = {How do policy and technological elites talk about privacy? Increasingly, researchers call for a multidimensional and contextual view of privacy as an object of study. Such calls have advanced both conceptual and empirical understanding of how citizens think about privacy and enact privacy-related behaviors in networked environments. At the same time, scandals such as Cambridge Analytica (CA) reveal gaps in perceptions of privacy held by the users vs. those in positions of power, who design and regulate information networks. Yet, studies of privacy perceptions of elites remain scarce. The current project contributes to filling this gap.Conceptually, our research builds on two main bodies of literature. First, we leverage research that distinguishes between vertical and horizontal dimensions of privacy. The former refers to privacy relationships of an individual vis-a-vis institutions, while the latter refers to privacy relationships vis-a-vis their peers. Previous studies suggest that information technology users prioritize horizontal thinking about privacy. Second, we build on framing literature, which suggests a link between frames in communication and frames in thought, as a way to systematically unpack elite discourses as representing their perceptions of privacy. Studies leveraging framing for privacy research suggest that internet policy deliberations harbor vertically oriented views of privacy. Empirically, we focus on US Congressional hearings following the CA scandal as a moment of explicit deliberation of privacy among policy and technological elites. We conduct a quantitative content analysis of the April 10, 2018 joint session of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where 44 Senators questioned a single witness - Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook's CEO). We develop and validate a dedicated coding scheme for the analysis of privacy discourses, and apply this scheme to systematically analyze 91 distinct interventions in the hearing.Our preliminary analysis suggests an overall dominance of vertical privacy framing, with institutions held responsible for both privacy infringement and privacy protection. While Mr. Zuckerberg had more references to horizontal privacy relationships among Facebook users, this behavior did not amount to statistically significant differences compared to the Senators. When taking into account the distance of privacy relationships, Republican Senators had significantly more references to primary relationships between Facebook and its users, while Democratic Senators focused on secondary information flows between Facebook and institutional third parties. Other emerging trends suggest that the Senators are more likely to view privacy as a right, compared to Mr. Zuckerberg. At the same time Republican Senators tend to view privacy more as a commodity compared to their Democratic counterparts. Currently, two main insights are emerging from this research. First, the dominance of vertical privacy framing in this elite discourse stands in stark contrast with earlier findings about the dominance of horizontal framing among the users of information technology. Second, it brings to surface the political nature of privacy as a vessel for normative perspectives and ideological positions. The full paper will draw a more nuanced picture of those dynamics, offering avenues for future research and policy considerations aimed at both designing and communicating privacy regulations.},

We discuss various measures of instability and analyze how they interact with the structure of the underlying preferences. Our main result is that even the outcome of decentralized matching with incomplete information can be expected to be ``almost stable'' under reasonable assumptions.},

But even this needs to be implemented with caution and sensitivity as evidence on how consumers react to the approach shows. In an era of self service and disintermediation, marketers are increasingly turning to customer data instead of the tacit understanding of customers they used to possess when interaction was on a more personal basis. There are, however, concerns over the nature of the data collected and the way in which it is used, that lead to a proposition that relationship marketing can be an oxymoron. Also, however, suggests a number of compromise solutions in an era in which marketers are unlikely to abandon the paradigm. If marketing reverted to earlier paradigms rather than promising cynical consumers a ``relationship'', perhaps all parties might actually start to gain more trust in each other. Personal rather than relational interaction would indeed be more pragmatic.},

  abstract = {Sharing cyber security information helps firms to decrease cyber security risks, prevent attacks, and increase their overall resilience. Hence it affects reducing the social security cost. Although previously cyber security information sharing was being performed in an informal and ad hoc manner, nowadays through development of information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs), cyber security information sharing has become more structured, regular, and frequent. This is while, the privacy risk and information disclosure concerns are still major challenges faced by ISACs that act as barriers in activating the potential impacts of ISACs. This paper provides insights on decisions about security investments and information sharing in consideration of privacy risk and security knowledge growth. By the latest concept i.e. security knowledge growth, we mean fusing the collected security information, adding prior knowledge, and performing extra analyses to enrich the shared information. The impact of this concept on increasing the motivation of firms for voluntarily sharing their sensitive information to authorities such as ISACs has been analytically studied for the first time in this paper. We propose a differential game model in which a linear fusion model for characterizing the process of knowledge growth via the ISAC is employed. The Nash equilibrium of the proposed game including the optimized values of security investment, and the thresholds of data sharing with the price of privacy are highlighted. We analytically find the threshold in which the gain achieved by sharing sensitive information outweighs the privacy risks and hence the firms have natural incentive to share their security information. Moreover, since in this case the threshold of data sharing and the security investment levels chosen in Nash equilibrium may be lower than social optimum, accordingly we design mechanisms which would encourage the firms and lead to a socially optimal outcome. The direct impact of the achieved results is on analyzing the way ISACs can convince firms to share their security information with them.},

Independent of question sensitivity, respondents gave less socially desirable answers more quickly when answering categorical and ordinal questions but more slowly when answering numeric questions.

This conception of privacy misses an important component of the policy problem. An individual who is careless with data exposes not only extensive information about herself, but about others as well. The negative externalities imposed on nonconsenting outsiders by such carelessness can be productively studied in terms of welfare economics. If all relevant individuals maximize private benefit, and expect all other relevant individuals to do the same, neoclassical economic theory predicts that society will achieve a suboptimal level of privacy. This prediction holds even if all individuals cherish privacy with the same intensity. As the theoretical literature would have it, the struggle for privacy is destined to become a tragedy.},

  abstract = {Background: Blockchain technology has the potential to enable more secure, transparent, and equitable data management. In the health care domain, it has been applied most frequently to electronic health records. In addition to securely managing data, blockchain has significant advantages in distributing data access, control, and ownership to end users. Due to this attribute, among others, the use of blockchain to power personal health records (PHRs) is especially appealing. Objective: This review aims to examine the current landscape, design choices, limitations, and future directions of blockchain-based PHRs. Methods: Adopting the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, a cross-disciplinary systematic review was performed in July 2020 on all eligible articles, including gray literature, from the following 8 databases: ACM, IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Three reviewers independently performed a full-text review and data abstraction using a standardized data collection form. Results: A total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria. In the review, we found that the blockchain PHR space has matured over the past 5 years, from purely conceptual ideas initially to an increasing trend of publications describing prototypes and even implementations. Although the eventual application of blockchain in PHRs is intended for the health care industry, the majority of the articles were found in engineering or computer science publications. Among the blockchain PHRs described, permissioned blockchains and off-chain storage were the most common design choices. Although 18 articles described a tethered blockchain PHR, all of them were at the conceptual stage. Conclusions: This review revealed that although research interest in blockchain PHRs is increasing and that the space is maturing, this technology is still largely in the conceptual stage. Being the first systematic review on blockchain PHRs, this review should serve as a basis for future reviews to track the development of the space. Trial Registration:},

Even in the absence of dysfunctional group-level processes, group members tend to stick to their suboptimal initial decision preferences due to preference-consistent evaluation of information. However, previous experiments demonstrating this effect retained two group-level processes, namely (a) social validation of information supporting the group members' initial preferences and (b) presentation of the additional information in a discussion format. Therefore, it was unclear whether the individual preference effect depends on the co-occurrence of these group-level processes. Here, we report two experiments demonstrating that the individual preference effect is indeed an individual-level phenomenon. Moreover, by a comparison to real interacting groups, we can show that even when all relevant information is exchanged and when no coordination losses occur, almost half of all groups would fail to solve hidden profiles due to the individual preference effect. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2010.},

We describe how uncertainty manifests in social environments (the thoughts and intentions of others are largely hidden, making it difficult to predict a person's behaviour) and why people are motivated to reduce the aversive feelings generated by uncertainty. We propose a three-part model whereby social uncertainty is initially reduced through automatic modes of inference (such as impression formation) before more control-demanding modes of inference (such as perspective-taking) are deployed to narrow one's predictions even more. Finally, social uncertainty is attenuated further through learning processes that update these predictions based on new information. Our framework integrates research across fields to offer an account of the mechanisms motivating social cognition and action, laying the groundwork for future experiments that can illuminate the impact of uncertainty on social cognition. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Nature Limited.},

  abstract = {We present a fascinating model that has lately caught attention among physicists working in complexity related fields. Though it originated from mathematics and later from economics, the model is very enlightening in many aspects that we shall highlight in this review. It is called The Stable Marriage Problem (though the marriage metaphor can be generalized to many other contexts), and it consists of matching men and women, considering preference-lists where individuals express their preference over the members of the opposite gender. This problem appeared for the first time in 1962 in the seminal paper of Gale and Shapley and has aroused interest in many fields of science, including economics, game theory, computer science, etc. Recently it has also attracted many physicists who, using the powerful tools of statistical mechanics, have also approached it as an optimization problem. Here we present a complete overview of the Stable Marriage Problem emphasizing its multidisciplinary aspect, and reviewing the key results in the disciplines that it has influenced most. We focus, in particular, in the old and recent results achieved by physicists, finally introducing two new promising models inspired by the philosophy of the Stable Marriage Problem. Moreover, we present an innovative reinterpretation of the problem, useful to highlight the revolutionary role of information in the contemporary economy.},

While previous accounts focus on group-dynamics and motivational biases, the present research applies a metacognitive perspective to an ordinary learning approach. Assuming that evaluative learning is sensitive to the frequency with which targets are paired with positive versus negative attributes, selective repetition of targets' assets and deficits will inevitably bias the resulting evaluations. As selective repetition effects are ubiquitous, metacognitive monitoring and control functions are required to correct for repetition biases. However, three experiments show that metacognitive myopia prevents judges from correction, even when explicitly warned to ignore selective repetition (Experiment 1), when same-speaker repetitions rule out social validation (Experiment 2) and when blatant debriefing enforces superficial corrections (Experiment 3). For a comprehensive understanding of collective judgments and decisions, it is essential to take metacognitive monitoring and control into account.},

Despite the students' perceived readiness and several studies on the topic, it is not fully understood what personally identifiable information college students are sharing via online social networks and on the Internet. This applied field study used a survey to collect data on college students at Frostburg State University with regard to how they share their personally identifiable information. The study then examined the amount of personally identifiable information Frostburg State University students shared based on a variety of factors such as if the students owned a particular technology, their college GPA, and their sex. Despite the possible consequences of sharing personally identifiable information, such as identity thief or cyber-stalking, this study discovered that the University students shared an alarming amount of information about themselves. College students should be aware of the amount of personally identifiable information that they are sharing on online social networks and the Internet. Exploring the type and amount of personally identifiable information that Frostburg State University college students reveal via online social networks and on the Internet enabled the researcher to create a pseudo-profile of the University student that shared personally identifiable information.

  abstract = {Under-reporting of concussions is a well-known public health problem. Unfortunately, concussion researchers and practitioners do not have an explicit theoretical foundation for understanding the psychology of concussion non-disclosure. We used interdependence theory, a theory based on the structure of social relationships, to develop a social dilemma model of personal information non-disclosure and apply it to the concussion domain. Self-disclosure becomes problematic when individuals perceive a need to report their concussions but also perceive that disclosure could be detrimental in some way. Individuals who experience these disclosure dilemmas can evaluate the value of concussion self-disclosure using direct outcomes (e.g. losing scholarships, improved recovery), self-concept outcomes (e.g. viewing disclosure as ``weak'' or ``sensible''), and social status outcomes (e.g. being perceived poorly or favorably by teammates). These immediate, personal outcomes are integrated with relationship-specific motives and ethical considerations ultimately leading to disclosure or non-disclosure. Providing an explicit theoretical basis for self-disclosure dilemmas is critical for understanding concussion non-disclosure and mitigating its corresponding harm. Our social dilemma model highlights (a) the foundational psychological basis for concussion non-disclosure, (b) possible reasons that initiatives designed to increase concussion disclosure have been ineffective, and (c) the need to consider the decision-making autonomy of concussed individuals. Although we explain our social dilemma model using concussion self-reporting, we believe that this model is applicable to any domain where individuals are reluctant to disclose personal information to others who need it.},

This paper presents the GDPR privacy label and uses two empirical studies to examine the effectiveness of this approach in influencing consumers' privacy perceptions and related behavioral intentions. Design/methodology/approach The paper tests the efficacy of two GDPR privacy label designs, a consent-based label and a static label. Study 1 examines the effects of each label on perceptions of risk, control and privacy. Study 2 investigates the influence of consumers' privacy perceptions on perceived trustworthiness and willingness to interact with the organization. Findings The findings support the potential of GDPR privacy labels for positively influencing perceptions of risk, control, privacy and trustworthiness and enhancing consumers' willingness to transact and disclose data to online organizations. Practical implications The findings are useful for organizations required to comply with the GDPR and present a solution to requirements for transparent communications and explicit consent. Originality/value This study examines and demonstrates the efficacy of visualized privacy policies in impacting consumer privacy perceptions and behavioral intentions.},

In emerging contexts, such as government surveillance technologies, there is a dearth of research investigating the positive and negative drivers of citizens' acceptance. This is an important gap given the importance of citizen acceptance to the success of these technologies and the need to balance potentially wide-reaching benefits with any dilution of citizen privacy. We conduct a longitudinal examination of the competing influences of positive beliefs and privacy concerns on citizens' acceptance of a COVID-19 national contact tracing mobile application among 405 Irish citizens. Combining privacy calculus theory with social exchange theory, we find that citizens' initial acceptance is shaped by their perceptions of health benefits and social influence, with reciprocity exhibiting a sustained influence on acceptance over time and privacy concerns demonstrating a negative, albeit weak influence on willingness to rely on the application. The study offers important empirical and theoretical implications for the privacy literature in the government surveillance, location-based services, and mobile health application contexts, as well as practical implications for governments and developers introducing applications that rely on mass acceptance and reciprocal information disclosure.},

Indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability\textemdash an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. The author examines the relation between CRT scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. The CRT scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive "style." The CRT scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences. The final section addresses the interpretation of correlations between cognitive abilities and decision-making characteristics.},

Because successful coordination requires complementary choices, these opportunities raise the puzzle of how people attain the common knowledge that facilitates coordination, in which a person knows X, knows that the other knows X, knows that the other knows that he knows, ad infinitum. We show that people are highly sensitive to the distinction between common knowledge and mere private or shared knowledge, and that they deploy this distinction strategically in diverse social situations that have the structure of coordination games, including market cooperation, innuendo, bystander intervention, attributions of charitability, self-conscious emotions, and moral condemnation.},

Both kinds of metacognition have implicit and explicit forms, where implicit means automatic and without awareness. Implicit metacognition enables us to adopt a we-mode, through which we automatically take account of the knowledge and intentions of others. Adoption of this mode enhances joint action. Explicit metacognition enables us to reflect on and justify our behaviour to others. However, access to the underlying processes is very limited for both self and others and our reports on our own and others' intentions can be very inaccurate. On the other hand, recent experiments have shown that, through discussions of our perceptual experiences with others, we can detect sensory signals more accurately, even in the absence of objective feedback. Through our willingness to discuss with others the reasons for our actions and perceptions, we overcome our lack of direct access to the underlying cognitive processes. This creates the potential for us to build more accurate accounts of the world and of ourselves. I suggest, therefore, that explicit metacognition is a uniquely human ability that has evolved through its enhancement of collaborative decision-making.},

Results revealed highest correlation between the HDS and NEO, showing neuroticism correlating (as predicted) with excitable (borderline) and cautious (avoidant); introversion correlating with avoidant (cautious), schizoid (detached), and (negatively) with colourful (histrionic); openness correlating with schizotypal (imaginative) and conscientiousness with diligent (obsessive-compulsive). Many of the 'overlaps' were suggested by Widiger, Trull, Clarkin, Sanderson, and Costa (2002). The overlap and lack of overlap is considered at the psychometric and conceptual level.

To answer this fundamental question, recent studies analyse decision times in game theory experiments under the assumption that intuitive decisions are fast and that deliberation is slow. These analyses keep track of the average time taken to make decisions under different conditions. Lacking any knowledge of the underlying dynamics, such simplistic approach might however lead to erroneous interpretations. Here we model the cognitive basis of strategic cooperative decision making using the Drift Diffusion Model to discern between deliberation and intuition and describe the evolution of the decision making in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma experiments. We find that, although initially people's intuitive decision is to cooperate, rational deliberation quickly becomes dominant over an initial intuitive bias towards cooperation, which is fostered by positive interactions as much as frustrated by a negative one. However, this initial pro-social tendency is resilient, as after a pause it resets to the same initial value. These results illustrate the new insight that can be achieved thanks to a quantitative modelling of human behavior. \textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The Web is a prominent platform for behavioral experiments, for many reasons (relative simplicity, ubiquity, and accessibility, among others). Over the last few years, many behavioral and social scientists have conducted Internet-based experiments using standard web technologies, both in native JavaScript and using research-oriented frameworks. At the same time, vendors of widely used web browsers have been working hard to improve the performance of their software. However, the goals of browser vendors do not always coincide with behavioral researchers' needs. Whereas vendors want high-performance browsers to respond almost instantly and to trade off accuracy for speed, researchers have the opposite trade-off goal, wanting their browser-based experiments to exactly match the experimental design and procedure. In this article, we review and test some of the best practices suggested by web-browser vendors, based on the features provided by new web standards, in order to optimize animations for browser-based behavioral experiments with high-resolution timing requirements. Using specialized hardware, we conducted four studies to determine the accuracy and precision of two different methods. The results using CSS animations in web browsers (Method 1) with GPU acceleration turned off showed biases that depend on the combination of browser and operating system. The results of tests on the latest versions of GPU-accelerated web browsers showed no frame loss in CSS animations. The same happened in many, but not all, of the tests conducted using requestAnimationFrame (Method 2) instead of CSS animations. Unbeknownst to many researchers, vendors of web browsers implement complex technologies that result in reduced quality of timing. Therefore, behavioral researchers interested in timing-dependent procedures should be cautious when developing browser-based experiments and should test the accuracy and precision of the whole experimental setup (web application, web browser, operating system, and hardware).},

If data could be owned by the people it identifies, the data handlers would have to pay to use that data for sales and marketing purposes. We are not suggesting payment would be the mostly illusory free services and hidden discounts that are the current answer but real money or an asset that can be bartered or purchased. If even the poorest people can gain an income this would revolutionise personal finance for those who register on the web either for purchases or to make their name available for use. We propose such a revolution in data ownership and urge all data generators to establish their rights to a business asset that they frequently gift to already wealthy organisations.

We present a rational model for inferring preferences from response times, using a drift diffusion model to characterize how preferences influence response time, and Bayesian inference to invert this relationship. We test our model's predictions for three experimental questions. Matching model predictions, participants inferred that a decision-maker preferred a chosen item more if the decision-maker spent less time deliberating (Experiment 1), participants predicted a decision-maker's choice in a novel comparison based on inferring the decision-maker's relative preferences from previous response times and choices (Experiment 2), and participants could incorporate information about a decision-maker's mental state of cautious or careless (Experiments 3, 4A, and 4B). \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Many firms try to leverage consumers' interactions on social platforms as part of their communication strategies. However, information on online social networks only propagates if it receives consumers' attention. This paper proposes a seeding strategy to maximize information propagation while accounting for competition for attention. The theory of exchange networks serves as the framework for identifying the optimal seeding strategy and recommends seeding people that have many friends, who, in turn, have only a few friends. There is little competition for the attention of those seeds' friends, and these friends are therefore responsive to the messages they receive. Using a game-theoretic model, we show that it is optimal to seed people with the highest Bonacich centrality. Importantly, in contrast to previous seeding literature that assumed a fixed and nonnegative connectivity parameter of the Bonacich measure, we demonstrate that this connectivity parameter is negative and needs to be estimated. Two independent empirical validations using a total of 34 social media campaigns on two different large online social networks show that the proposed seeding strategy can substantially increase a campaign's reach. The second study uses the activity network of messages exchanged to confirm that the effects are driven by competition for attention.

  abstract = {Although survey results show that the privacy of their personal data is an important issue for online users worldwide, most users rarely make an effort to protect this data actively and often even give it away voluntarily. Privacy researchers have made several attempts to explain this dichotomy between privacy attitude and behavior, usually referred to as `privacy paradox'. While they proposed different theoretical explanations for the privacy paradox, as well as empirical study results concerning the relationship of individual factors on privacy behavior and attitude, no comprehensive explanation for the privacy paradox has been found so far. We aim to shed light on the privacy paradox phenomenon by summarizing the most popular theoretical privacy paradox explanations and identifying the factors that are most relevant for the prediction of privacy attitude and behavior. Since many studies focus on the behavioral intention instead of the actual behavior, we decided to consider this topic as well. Based on a literature review, we identify all factors that significantly predict one of the three privacy aspects and report the corresponding standardized effect sizes ({$\beta$}). The results provide strong evidence for the theoretical explanation approach called `privacy calculus', with possibly gained benefits being among the best predictors for disclosing intention as well as actual disclosure. Other strong predictors for privacy behavior are privacy intention, willingness to disclose, privacy concerns and privacy attitude. Demographic variables play a minor role, only gender was found to weakly predict privacy behavior. Privacy attitude was best predicted by internal variables like trust towards the website, privacy concerns or computer anxiety. Despite the multiplicity of survey studies dealing with user privacy, it is not easy to draw overall conclusions, because authors often refer to slightly different constructs. We suggest the privacy research community to agree on a shared definition of the different privacy constructs to allow for conclusions beyond individual samples and study designs.},

Third, noting that it is ultimately not the objective structure of situations that determines behavior, but individuals' subjective perception thereof, we summarize recent research showing that individuals only reliably differentiate between five\textemdash not six\textemdash dimensions of interdependence, and we describe the link between these dimensions and personality traits. Last, we outline directions for future research such as studying personality as a moderator of the link between interdependence perceptions and behavior, investigating the influence of the interaction partner on an actor's situation perception, and uncovering how the interdependence dimensions may interact to influence the relation between personality and behavior.},

  abstract = {A mechanism for releasing information about a statistical database with sensitive data must resolve a trade-off between utility and privacy. Publishing fully accurate information maximizes utility while minimizing privacy, while publishing random noise accomplishes the opposite. Privacy can be rigorously quantified using the framework of differential privacy, which requires that a mechanism's output distribution is nearly the same whether a given database row is included. The goal of this paper is to formulate and provide strong and general utility guarantees, subject to differential privacy. We pursue mechanisms that guarantee near-optimal utility to every potential user, independent of its side information (modeled as a prior distribution over query results) and preferences (modeled via a symmetric and monotone loss function). Our main result is the following: for each fixed count query and differential privacy level, there is a geometric mechanism M*-a discrete variant of the simple and well-studied mechanism that adds random noise from a Laplace distribution-that is simultaneously expected loss-minimizing for every possible user, subject to the differential privacy constraint. This is an extremely strong utility guarantee: every potential user u, no matter what its side information and preferences, derives as much utility from M * as from interacting with a differentially private mechanism Mu that is optimally tailored to u. More precisely, for every user u there is an optimal mechanism Mu for it that factors into a user-independent part (the geometric mechanism M*) and a user-specific postprocessing step that depends only on the output of the geometric mechanism and not on the underlying database. The first part of our proof of this result characterizes the optimal differentially private mechanism for a user as a certain basic feasible solution to a linear program with a user-specific objective function and user-independent constraints that encode differential privacy. The second part shows that all of the relevant vertices of the feasible region (ranging over all possible users) are derivable from the geometric mechanism via suitable remappings of its range.

They help us to understand the relationships between people and the environment at all scales, and to consider the active roles individuals, groups, and social structures play in creating the environments in which people live, work, and play. These readings highlight the ways in which space and place are produced through large- and small-scale social, political, and economic practices, and offer new ways to think about how people engage the environment in multiple and diverse ways.  Providing an essential resource for students of urban studies, geography, sociology and many other areas, this book brings together important but, till now, widely dispersed writings across many inter-related disciplines. Introductions from the editors precede each section; introducing the texts, demonstrating their significance, and outlining the key issues surrounding the topic. A companion website, PeoplePlaceSpace.org, extends the work even further by providing an on-going series of additional reading lists that cover issues ranging from food security to foreclosure, psychiatric spaces to the environments of predator animals.},

  abstract = {The Dunning-Kruger hypothesis states that the degree to which people can estimate their ability accurately depends, in part, upon possessing the ability in question. Consequently, people with lower levels of the ability tend to self-assess their ability less well than people who have relatively higher levels of the ability. The most common method used to test the Dunning-Kruger hypothesis involves plotting the self-assessed and objectively assessed means across four categories (quartiles) of objective ability. However, this method has been argued to be confounded by the better-than-average effect and regression toward the mean. In this investigation, it is argued that the Dunning-Kruger hypothesis can be tested validly with two inferential statistical techniques: the Glejser test of heteroscedasticity and nonlinear (quadratic) regression. On the basis of a sample of 929 general community participants who completed a self-assessment of intelligence and the Advanced Raven's Progressive Matrices, we failed to identify statistically significant heteroscedasticity, contrary to the Dunning-Kruger hypothesis. Additionally, the association between objectively measured intelligence and self-assessed intelligence was found to be essentially entirely linear, again, contrary to the Dunning-Kruger hypothesis. It is concluded that, although the phenomenon described by the Dunning-Kruger hypothesis may be to some degree plausible for some skills, the magnitude of the effect may be much smaller than reported previously.},

We employed word embeddings and qualitative analysis to identify which information privacy concerns are present and characterize language and regional differences in emphasis on these concerns.

We also observe a greater emphasis on data collection in English than in Spanish. Additionally, data from North America exhibits a narrower focus on awareness compared to other regions under study.

For each embedding, we conducted open coding to characterize the semantic contexts of key concepts: "information", "privacy", "company" and "users" (and their Spanish translations). Through a comparative analysis, we found a broader emphasis on privacy-related words associated with companies in English. We also identified more terms related to data collection in English and fewer associated with security mechanisms, control, and risks.

Researchers across disciplines have formulated different theories on why consumers' privacy concerns do not translate into increased protective behaviour. Over the past two decades multiple differing explanations for the paradox have been published. However, authors generally agree that companies are in a strong position to reduce consumers' paradoxical behaviour by improving their customers' informational privacy. Hence, this paper aims at answering the question: How can companies address the privacy paradox to improve their customers' information privacy? Reviewing a sample of improvement recommendations from 138 papers that explore 41 theories in total, we determined that companies can generally align their privacy practices more closely with customers' expectations across 4 inter-connected managerial processes: (1) strategic initiatives, (2) structural improvements, (3) human resource management, and (4) service development. The findings of this systematic literature review detail how companies can address both the rational and irrational nature of the privacy decision-making process. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic model able to identify weaknesses and strengths in companies' privacy orientation.},

  abstract = {Mind perception is the essence of moral judgment. Broadly, moral standing is linked to perceptions of mind, with moral responsibility tied to perceived agency, and moral rights tied to perceived experience. More specifically, moral judgments are based on a fundamental template of two perceived minds\textemdash an intentional agent and a suffering patient. This dyadic template grows out of the universal power of harm, and serves as a cognitive working model through which even atypical moral events are understood. Thus, all instances of immorality are perceived to involve both blame-worthy agents (i.e., acts) and suffering victims (i.e., consequences). Because moral cognition simultaneously concerns acts and consequences, theories which focus primarily on acts (i.e., deontology) or consequences (i.e., utilitarianism) do not accurately describe moral cognition. Indeed, the phenomenon of dyadic completion suggests that deontological and utilitarian concerns are not only simultaneously active, but also typically compatible and reinforcing: wrong acts have harmful consequences, and harmful consequences stem from wrong acts. The cognitive fusion of acts with consequences suggests that normative conflicts between deontology and utilitarianism are not reflected in everyday moral judgment. This in turn suggests that empirical conclusions drawn from moral dilemmas that pit utilitarianism against deontology\textemdash i.e., trolley problems\textemdash give an skewed account of moral cognition.

If, all else equal, people regard the self as good (i.e., engage in self-enhancement), and good theories are true (in accord with their intended function), then people should regard their own theories as true; otherwise put, they should manifest a spontaneous preference for their own theories (i.e., a SPOT effect). In three experiments, participants were introduced to a theory about which of two imaginary alien species preyed upon the other. Participants then considered in turn several items of evidence bearing on the theory and each time evaluated the likelihood that the theory was true versus false. As hypothesized, participants regarded the theory as more likely to be true when it was arbitrarily ascribed to them as opposed to an ``Alex'' (Experiment 1) or to no one (Experiment 2).

Specifically we examine choice behavior in the contexts of role certainty, role uncertainty, decomposed games, and matrix games. Results show that there is large heterogeneity in the choices people make when deciding how to allocate resources between themselves and some other person under different contextual frames. For instance, people make more prosocial choices under role uncertainty as compared to role certainty. Furthermore, altering the way information is displayed given a particular situation can have a more dramatic effect on choice behavior than altering the situation itself. That is, depending on how information is displayed, people may behave as if they would perform a non-strategic decision making task when in fact they are playing a proper game characterized by strategic interdependence.},

An uninformed, random vote generates a negative externality since it may override an informative group decision in pivotal events. In our experiments, participants in randomly re-matched groups obtain information more often with compulsory than voluntary voting, and the average number of signals is greater in larger than smaller groups. Surprisingly, uninformed voting is common even in the voluntary mode!

Cases are distinguished where the voters are allies (support the same group) or adversaries (with opposing preferences) and where they are uncertain about each other's preferences. Our experimental results show that the social embeddedness matters: this information increases aggregate turnout by approximately 50\%. The largest effect is observed for allies. Early voters strategically try to use their first mover position and late voters respond to this.},

Alone and together, climatic changes, population growth, and economic scarcity create shared problems that can be tackled effectively through cooperation and coordination. Perhaps because cooperation is fragile and easily breaks down, societies also provide individual solutions to shared problems, such as privatized healthcare or retirement planning. But how does the availability of individual solutions affect free-riding and the efficient creation of public goods? We confronted groups of individuals with a shared problem that could be solved either individually or collectively. Across different cost-benefit ratios of individually versus collectively solving the shared problem, individuals display a remarkable tendency toward group-independent, individual solutions. This ``individualism'' leads to inefficient resource allocations and coordination failure. Introducing peer punishment further results in wasteful punishment feuds between ``individualists'' and ``collectivists.'' In the presence of individual solutions to shared problems, groups struggle to balance self-reliance and collective efficiency, leading to a ``modern tragedy of the commons.''},

A 10x10-fold cross-validation was used to ensure that the results of the linear regression models are reproducible. The findings indicate that machine learning techniques can improve the prediction of relationship quality (37\% of variance explained), and that the perceived relationship quality of a partner is mostly dependent on his or her own individual personality traits. Additionally, the influences of different sets of variables on predictions are shown: partner and similarity effects did not incrementally predict relationship quality beyond actor effects and general personality traits predicted relationship quality less strongly than relationship-related personality.},

Previous research extensively investigated how groups solve this free-rider problem but ignored another challenge to public goods provision. Namely, some individuals do not need public goods to solve the problems they share with others. We investigate how such self-reliance influences cooperation by confronting groups in a laboratory experiment with a safety problem that could be solved either cooperatively or individually. We show that self-reliance leads to a decline in cooperation. Moreover, asymmetries in self-reliance undermine social welfare and increase wealth inequality between group members. Less dependent group members often choose to solve the shared problem individually, while more dependent members frequently fail to solve the problem, leaving them increasingly poor. While self-reliance circumvents the free-rider problem, it complicates the governing of the commons. \textcopyright{} 2020, The Author(s).},

It is widely used in the evaluation of human factors of PETs and the investigation of the privacy paradox. Even though its predecessor Concern For Information Privacy (CFIP) has been evaluated independently and the instrument itself seen some scrutiny, we are still missing a dedicated confirmation of IUIPC-10, itself. We aim at closing this gap by systematically analyzing IUIPC's construct validity and reliability. We obtained three mutually independent samples with a total of N = 1031 participants. We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on our main sample to assert the validity and reliability of IUIPC-10. Having found weaknesses, we proposed a respecified instrument IUIPC-8 with improved psychometric properties. Finally, we confirmed our findings on a validation sample. While we found sound foundations for content validity and could confirm the overall three-dimensionality of IUIPC-10, we observed evidence of biases in the question wording and found that IUIPC-10 consistently missed the mark in evaluations of construct validity and reliability, calling into question the unidimensionality of its sub-scales Awareness and Control. Our respecified scale IUIPC-8 offers a statistically significantly better model and outperforms IUIPC-10's construct validity and reliability. The disconfirming evidence on IUIPC-10's construct validity raises doubts how well it measures the latent variable Information Privacy Concern. The less than desired reliability could yield spurious and erratic results as well as attenuate relations with other latent variables, such as behavior. Thereby, the instrument could confound studies of human factors of PETs or the privacy paradox, in general.},

It  produces scores for four domains related to quality of life:  physical health, psychological, social  relationships and environment. It also includes one facet on overall  quality of life and general health.Results. Domain scores produced by the WHOQOL-BREF correlate   highly (0{$\cdot$}89 or above) with  WHOQOL-100 domain scores (calculated on a four domain structure). WHOQOL-BREF  domain  scores demonstrated good discriminant validity, content validity,  internal consistency and test\textendash retest reliability.Conclusion. These data suggest that the WHOQOL-BREF provides   a valid and reliable alternative  to the assessment of domain profiles using the WHOQOL-100. It is envisaged  that the  WHOQOL-BREF will be most useful in studies that require a brief assessment   of quality of life, for example,  in large epidemiological studies and clinical trials where quality of  life is of interest. In addition, the  WHOQOL-BREF may be of use to health professionals in the assessment and  evaluation of  treatment efficacy.},

Split-plot analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that coordination rules were implicitly learned and then transferred successfully to new rules of similar difficulty and that coordination can occur without verbal mediation or leadership actions. Transfer of coordination was less positive to a task of greater difficulty. Nonlinear regression showed that fixed-point attractors could be extracted from all learning curves. The difficult shift contained a second chaotic process and a critical utility threshold at which the difficult rule could be mastered or not.

Our experimental environment is set up to make it complicated for players to use rational calculation for making the cooperative decisions.

Based on this, we measure the error that players make when estimating the benefits of collaboration, and find that humans massively underestimate these benefits when facing easy problems or working alone or in small groups. In contrast, when confronting hard problems or collaborating in large groups, humans accurately judge the best level of collaboration and easily achieve the maximal score. Our findings are independent on groups' composition and players' personal traits. We interpret them as varying degrees of usefulness of social heuristics, which seems to depend on the size of the involved group and the complexity of the situation. \textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s).},

Instructed response items (IRIs) provide a measure for inattentiveness in grid questions that is easy to implement. The present article adds to the sparse research on the use and implementation of attention checks by addressing three research objectives. In a first study, we provide evidence that IRIs identify respondents who show an elevated use of straightlining, speeding, item nonresponse, inconsistent answers, and implausible statements throughout a survey. Excluding inattentive respondents, however, did not alter the results of substantive analyses. Our second study suggests that respondents' inattentiveness partially changes as the context in which they complete the survey changes. In a third study, we present experimental evidence that a mere exposure to an IRI does not negatively or positively affect response behavior within a survey. A critical discussion on using IRI attention checks concludes this article.},

  abstract = {Many practitioners as well as researchers explore promoting environmentally conscious behavior in the context of public goods systems. Numerous experimental studies revealed various types of incentives to increase cooperation on public goods. There is ample evidence that monetary and non-monetary incentives, such as donations, have a positive effect on cooperation in public goods games that exceeds fully rational and optimal economic decision making. Despite an accumulation of these studies, in the typical setting of these experiments participants decide on an allocation of resources to a public pool, but they never exert actual effort. However, in reality, we often observe that players' real effort is required in these public goods game situations. Therefore, more analysis is needed to draw conclusions for a wider set of incentive possibilities in situations similar to yet deviating from resource allocation games. Here we construct a real effort public goods game in an online experiment and statistically analyze the effect different types of incentives have on cooperation. In our experiment, we examine combinations of monetary and social incentives in a setting aimed closer to practical realities, such as financial costs and real effort forming part of the decision to cooperate on a public good. In our real effort public goods game participants cooperate and defect on image-scoring tasks. We find that in our setting economic and social incentives produce an asymmetric effect. Interestingly economic incentives decreased the share of highly uncooperative participants, while social incentives raised the share of highly cooperative participants. \textcopyright{} 2021 Hackel et al.

They predicted that contribution behavior would have opposite effects on 2 forms of status-prestige and dominance-depending on its consequences for the self, in-group and out-group members. When the only way to benefit in-group members was by harming out-group members (Study 1), contributions increased prestige and decreased dominance, compared with free-riding. Adding the option of benefitting in-group members without harming out-group members (Study 2) decreased the prestige and increased the dominance of those who chose to benefit in-group members via intergroup competition. Finally, sharing resources with both in-group and out-group members decreased perceptions of both prestige and dominance, compared with sharing them with in-group members only (Study 3). Prestige and dominance differentially mediated the effects of contribution behavior on leader election, exclusion from the group, and choices of a group representative for an intergroup competition. Taken together, these findings show that the well-established relationship between contribution and status is moderated by both the intergroup context and the conceptualization of status. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {Background The wisdom of crowds and collective decision-making are important tools for integrating information between individuals, which can exceed the capacity of individual judgments. They are based on different forms of information integration. The wisdom of crowds refers to the aggregation of many independent judgments without deliberation and consensus, while collective decision-making is aggregation with deliberation and consensus. Recent research has shown that collective decision-making outperforms the wisdom of crowds. Additionally, many studies have shown that metacognitive knowledge of subjective confidence is useful for improving aggregation performance. However, because most of these studies have employed relatively simple problems; for example, involving general knowledge and estimating values and quantities of objects, it remains unclear whether their findings can be generalized to real-life situations involving complex information integration. This study explores the performance and process of the wisdom of crowds and collective decision-making by applying the wisdom of crowds with weighted confidence to a survival situation task commonly used in studies of collective decision-making. Results The wisdom of crowds and collective decision-making outperformed individual judgment. However, collective decision-making did not outperform the wisdom of crowds. Contrary to previous studies, weighted confidence showed no advantage from comparison between confidence-weighted and non-weighted aggregations; a simulation analysis varying in group size and sensitivity of confidence weighting revealed interaction between group size and sensitivity of confidence weighting. This reveals that it is because of small group size and not the peculiarity of the survival task that results in no advantage of weighted confidence. Conclusions The study's findings suggest that the wisdom of crowds could be applicable to complex problem-solving tasks, and interaction between group size and sensitivity of confidence weighting is important for confidence-weighted aggregation effects.},

In recent years, the area of social networks became very popular mainly through the development of social media and Internet social websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, ResearchGate, and many others. Graph theory offers suitable mathematical representations for social networking models. We describe in this paper some enumerative, stochastic and statistical tools allowing the analysis of time-varying social networks. Indeed, the study of social networksthrough the theory of random graphs and dynamic network analysis has enabled us to develop probabilistic and statistical approaches to calculate some indices and measures that characterize the dynamic behavior of such the networks through time.},

Privacy concerns can strongly influence users' decision to use a service. The Internet Users Information Privacy Concerns (IUIPC) construct is one operationalization to measure the impact of privacy concerns on the use of technologies. However, when applied to a privacy enhancing technology (PET) such as an anonymization service the original rationales do not hold anymore. In particular, an inverted impact of trusting and risk beliefs on behavioral intentions can be expected. We show that the IUIPC model needs to be adapted for the case of PETs. In addition, we extend the original causal model by including trusting beliefs in the anonymization service itself as well as a measure for privacy literacy. A survey among 124 users of the anonymization service Tor shows that trust in Tor has a statistically significant effect on the actual use behavior of the PET. In addition, the results indicate that privacy literacy has a negative impact on trusting beliefs in general and a positive effect on trust in Tor.},

The unique contribution of this research lies in its exploration of the interplay between perceived usefulness of the fashion brand's social media and peer communication on the fashion brand's social media in driving trust in the fashion brand's social media and, ultimately, purchase intention. Theoretically, we combine the technology acceptance model and consumer socialisation theory to explore the mediating role of trust in a rapidly expanding and growing industry sector. In surveying 150 Europeans to test our hypotheses around the aforementioned concepts, findings show that the perceived usefulness of a brand's social media is impacted by a set of atmospheric cues, and it influences the level of trust in both the fashion brand and its social media channels. Peer communication also influences perceived usefulness and level of trust in both the fashion brand and its social media channels. Trust in the brand but not its social media channels impacts purchase intention. The role of privacy concerns is limited in our model. We draw implications for theory around combining consumer socialisation theory and the technology acceptance model and for managers around parallel strategies to build different sets of trust on social media.},

But later the theory is extended also to cases where the different players' subjective probability distributions fail to satisfy this consistency assumption.In cases where the consistency assumption holds, the original game can be replaced by a game where nature first conducts a lottery in accordance with the basic probability distribution, and the outcome of this lottery will decide which particular subgame will be played, i.e., what the actual values of the relevant parameters will be in the game. Yet, each player will receive only partial information about the outcome of the lottery, and about the values of these parameters. However, every player will know the ``basic probability distribution'' governing the lottery. Thus, technically, the resulting game will be a game with complete information. It is called the Bayes-equivalent of the original game. Part I of the paper describes the basic model and discusses various intuitive interpretations for the latter. Part II shows that the Nash equilibrium points of the Bayes-equivalent game yield ``Bayesian equilibrium points'' for the original game. Finally, Part III considers the main properties of the ``basic probability distribution''.},

Despite important social functions gossip has a rather negative reputation. Therefore, the present online study focuses on the reasons why people gossip and how these reasons are related to personality (i.e., dark triad) and situational settings. Six distinct motives were identified that underlie gossip behavior: information validation, information gathering, relationship building, protection, social enjoyment, and negative influence. The most important motive was validating information about the gossip target followed by the motive to acquire new information about the gossip target. The least important motive was harming the gossip target. The motivational pattern was highly similar between private and work context. Interestingly, the importance of motives mainly depends on the gossiper's narcissism both in work and in private settings. The findings suggest that the negative reputation of gossip is not justified. In fact, even "dark" personalities appear to use gossip to tune their picture of other humans and themselves and not to harm others. \textcopyright{} 2019 Hartung, Krohn and Pirschtat.},

This research, however, cannot determine whether the uniformity results from universal patterns of human behavior or from the limited cultural variation available among the university students used in virtually all prior experimental work. To address this, we undertook a cross-cultural study of behavior in ultimatum, public goods, and dictator games in a range of small-scale societies exhibiting a wide variety of economic and cultural conditions. We found, first, that the canonical model - based on self-interest - fails in all of the societies studied. Second, our data reveal substantially more behavioral variability across social groups than has been found in previous research. Third, group-level differences in economic organization and the structure of social interactions explain a substantial portion of the behavioral variation across societies: the higher the degree of market integration and the higher the payoffs to cooperation in everyday life, the greater the level of prosociality expressed in experimental games. Fourth, the available individual-level economic and demographic variables do not consistently explain game behavior, either within or across groups. Fifth, in many cases experimental play appears to reflect the common interactional patterns of everyday life.},

Providing people with a prior consent option is sufficient to generate chilling effects (i.e., a reduction of norm-deviant behavior). However, nudging people towards potential publicity does not increase the value they place on privacy. We also test how the default design of the right to deletion of personal information (right to be forgotten) affects chilling effects and privacy valuations. Surprisingly, the right to be forgotten does not reduce chilling effects. Moreover, individuals tend to stick with the status quo of permanent information storage.},

The functionality and success of these systems lie in their ability to establish and maintain user trust; with too much or too little trust leading to over-reliance and under-utilisation, respectively. This problem highlights the need for an appropriate trust calibration methodology, with the work in this paper focusing on the first step: investigating user trust as a behavioural prior. Two pilot studies (Study 1 and 2) are presented, the results of which inform the design of Study 3. Study 3 investigates whether trust can determine user decision making and task outcome during a human-agent collaborative task. Results demonstrate that trust can be behaviourally assessed in this context using an adapted version of the Trust Game. Further, an initial behavioural measure of trust can significantly predict task outcome. Finally, assistance type and task difficulty interact to impact user performance. Notably, participants were able to improve their performance on the hard task when paired with correct assistance, with this improvement comparable to performance on the easy task with no assistance. Future work will focus on investigating factors that influence user trust during human-agent collaborative tasks and providing a domain-independent model of trust calibration. \textcopyright{} 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

Furthermore, shared information and unshared information have different decisional implications, and the alternative implied by the unshared information is the correct one given all information available to the group. However, no group member can detect this best solution on the basis of her or his individual information prior to discussion; it can only be found by pooling the unshared information during group discussion.

Current ethics codes consistently limit the use of deception to cases in which non-deceptive alternatives are unfeasible and, crucially, require that participants subjected to deception be debriefed correspondingly along with an option to withdraw their data after learning about the deception. These conditions pose a particular challenge in the context of web-based research because participants can typically discontinue a study unilaterally (i.e., dropout by simply closing the browser window) in which case full debriefing and an option to withdraw one s data are no longer available. As a consequence, the study would no longer be compatible with ethical standards. Based on recent meta-analytical data, we provide an existence proof of this problem, showing that deception is used in web-based research with little to no indication of safeguards ensuring full debriefing and subsequent data withdrawal options. We close by revisiting recommendations for the (non-)use of deception in web-based research and offer solutions to implement such safeguards in case deception is truly unavoidable. \textcopyright{} 2021 Hogrefe Verlag GmbH \& Co.

This study proposes a strategy to address these challenges through a careful combination of model analysis and implementation methods. In this strategy, computationally frugal model analysis methods (often requiring a few dozen parallelizable model runs) play a major role, and computationally demanding methods are used for problems where (relatively) inexpensive diagnostics suggest the frugal methods are unreliable. We also argue in favor of detecting and, where possible, eliminating unrealistic model nonlinearities\textemdash this increases the realism of the model itself and facilitates the application of frugal methods. Literature examples are used to demonstrate the use of frugal methods and associated diagnostics. We suggest that the strategy proposed in this paper would allow the environmental sciences community to achieve greater transparency and falsifiability of environmental models, and obtain greater scientific insight from ongoing and future modeling efforts.},

These signals become important in determining privacy outcomes when they reference an enforceable legal basis, as is the case with recent signals such as the Global Privacy Control and the Transparency \& Consent Framework. However, the coexistence of multiple privacy preference signals creates ambiguity as users may transmit more than one signal. This paper collects evidence about ambiguity flowing from the aforementioned two signals and the historic Do Not Track signal. We provide the first empirical evidence that ambiguous signals are sent by web users in the wild. We also show that preferences stored in the browser are reliable predictors of privacy preferences expressed in web dialogs. Finally, we provide the first evidence that popular cookie dialogs are blocked by the majority of users who adopted the Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control standards. These empirical results inform forthcoming legal debates about how to interpret privacy preference signals.},

One theory is that dropout or attrition occurs in phases that can be generalized to phases of high dropout and phases of stable use. In order to detect these phases, several methods are explored. First, existing methods and user-specified thresholds are applied to survey data where significant changes in the dropout rate between two questions is interpreted as the start or end of a high dropout phase. Next, survey dropout is considered as a time-to-event outcome and tests within change-point hazard models are introduced. Performance of these change-point hazard models is compared. Finally, all methods are applied to survey data on patient cancer screening preferences, testing the null hypothesis of no phases of attrition (no change-points) against the alternative hypothesis that distinct attrition phases exist (at least one change-point).},

In this view, dishonesty is facilitated by justifications that redefine moral boundaries. By contrast, the bounded ethicality approach suggests that biased perception prevents people from becoming aware of their dishonesty. We tested the key process assumptions behind these accounts using pupillary responses and fixation data and found physiological evidence for both kinds of mechanisms. In particular, physiological arousal increased at the initial stage of cheating responses. This suggests that people are on some level aware of their wrongdoings. At the same time, however, we found attentional biases that can reduce the likelihood for detecting potentially disadvantageous information. We suggest that dishonest acts come at the internal cost of increased tension, which people aim to avoid by pre-emptive biased processing as well as post hoc justifications.

They provide immediate access to a large and diverse subject pool, and allow researchers to control the experimental context. Online experiments, we show, can be just as valid\textemdash both internally and externally\textemdash as laboratory and field experiments, while often requiring far less money and time to design and conduct. To demonstrate their value, we use an online labor market to replicate three classic experiments. The first finds quantitative agreement between levels of cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma played online and in the physical laboratory. The second shows\textemdash consistent with behavior in the traditional laboratory\textemdash that online subjects respond to priming by altering their choices. The third demonstrates that when an identical decision is framed differently, individuals reverse their choice, thus replicating a famed Tversky-Kahneman result. Then we conduct a field experiment showing that workers have upward-sloping labor supply curves. Finally, we analyze the challenges to online experiments, proposing methods to cope with the unique threats to validity in an online setting, and examining the conceptual issues surrounding the external validity of online results. We conclude by presenting our views on the potential role that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and then recommend software development priorities and best practices.},

These assumptions usually claim that internet users who have higher privacy concerns will disclose less information, and that data subjects are always adversarial to data users without considering social contexts. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} The study surveyed 400 respondents from China, The Netherlands, Taiwan and the USA. It examined not only their privacy concerns, but also their actual practices, in order to identify any similarities between concerns and practices. Findings \textendash{} This study proved that internet users' privacy concerns do not reflect their privacy practices and showed how social contexts (Web category) influence users' privacy practices. Respondents from China, The Netherlands, Taiwan and the USA perceive Website categories in different ways, reflecting the influences of political systems, cultural background and economic development. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} This study maintains that future research on online privacy should take contexts or situations into account. To confirm this, additional research should be undertaken on how social contexts in other countries affect users' privacy concerns and practices. Investigators should also study what makes users more likely to disclose information. Originality/value \textendash{} This study suggests that legislation provides the basic protection, while self-regulation supplies the detailed principles of online privacy. Privacy education teaches users how to create their ``zone of privacy'' and how to be responsible for their online practices, in order to build an abuse-free information environment on the internet.},

To acquire data for training algorithms and eventually empowering the digital transformation, data marketplaces are often required to support and coordinate cross-organizational data transactions. However, the prior industry practices have suggested that the transaction costs in the data marketplaces are severely high, and the supporting infrastructure is far from mature. This paper proposes a data attributes-affected data exchange (DADE) conceptual model to understand the challenges and directions for developing data marketplaces. Specifically, our model framework is built upon two dimensions, data lifecycle maturity and data asset specificity. Based on the DADE model, we propose four approaches for developing data marketplaces and discuss future research directions with an overview of computational methods as potential technical solutions.},

Such posts bring social benefits to the users who post them but also to their friends who view them. Yet, they also represent a severe threat to the users' privacy, as co-location information introduces interdependences between users. We propose the first game-theoretic framework for analyzing the strategic behaviors, in terms of information sharing, of users of OSNs. To design parametric utility functions that are representative of the users' actual preferences, we also conduct a survey of 250 Facebook users and use conjoint analysis to quantify the users' benefits o f sharing vs. viewing (co)-location information and their preference for privacy vs. benefits. Our survey findings expose the fact that, among the users, there is a large variation, in terms of these preferences. We extensively evaluate our framework through data-driven numerical simulations. We study how users' individual preferences influence each other's decisions, we identify several factors that significantly affect these decisions (among which, the mobility data of the users), and we determine situations where dangerous patterns can emerge (e.g., a vicious circle of sharing, or an incentive to over-share)},

Privacy regulations, such as General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union (EU), aim to protect users' online information privacy.

This work aims to study mobile users' privacy concerns towards mobile apps by examining the effects of general and specific privacy assurance statements in China and the EU. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on ecological rationality and heuristics theory, an online experiment and a follow-up validation experiment were conducted in the EU and China to examine the effects of privacy assurance statements on mobile users' privacy concerns. Findings When privacy regulation is presented, the privacy concerns of Chinese mobile users are significantly lowered compared with EU mobile users. This indicates that individuals in the two regions react differently to privacy assurances. However, when a general regulation statement is used, no effect is observed. EU and Chinese respondents remain unaffected by general assurance statements.

Today, individuals can obtain their digital genomic sequences at reasonable prices from many online service providers. Individuals can store their data on personal devices, reveal it on public online databases, or share it with third parties. Yet, it has been shown that genomic data is very privacy-sensitive and highly correlated between relatives. Therefore, individuals' decisions about how to manage and secure their genomic data are crucial. People of the same family might have very different opinions about (i) how to protect and (ii) whether or not to reveal their genome. We study this tension by using a game-theoretic approach. First, we model the interplay between two purely-selfish family members. We also analyze how the game evolves when relatives behave altruistically. We define closed-form Nash equilibria in different settings. We then extend the game to N players by means of multi-agent influence diagrams that enable us to efficiently compute Nash equilibria. Our results notably demonstrate that altruism does not always lead to a more efficient outcome in genomic-privacy games. They also show that, if the discrepancy between the genome-sharing benefits that players perceive is too high, they will follow opposite sharing strategies, which has a negative impact on the familial utility.},

The scale was administered to 43 male and female graduate social work students to test for the internal consistency of each subscale, and high alpha coefficients were obtained for each subscale. The subscales were not correlated with one another which suggests their independence. To test for temporal stability, the scale was administered twice to 19 of the students. High correlation coefficients were produced between time 1 and time 2 for each of the items. Thus, a short, internally consistent and stable scale was developed to measure five specific privacy issues.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology provides a tremendous opportunity to transform current personal health record (PHR) systems into a decentralised network infrastructure. However, such technology possesses some drawbacks, such as issues in privacy and storage capacity. Given its transparency and decentralised features, medical data are visible to everyone on the network and are inappropriate for certain medical applications. By contrast, storing vast medical data, such as patient medical history, laboratory tests, X-rays, and MRIs, significantly affect the repository storage of blockchain. This study bridges the gap between PHRs and blockchain technology by offloading the vast medical data into the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage and establishing an enforced cryptographic authorisation and access control scheme for outsourced encrypted medical data. The access control scheme is constructed on the basis of the new lightweight cryptographic concept named smart contract-based attribute-based searchable encryption (SC-ABSE). This newly cryptographic primitive is developed by extending ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) and by leveraging the technology of smart contracts to achieve the following: (1) efficient and secure fine-grained access control of outsourced encrypted data, (2) confi-dentiality of data by eliminating trusted private key generators, and (3) multikeyword searchable mechanism. Based on decisional bilinear Diffie\textendash Hellman hardness assumptions (DBDH) and discrete logarithm (DL) problems, the rigorous security indistinguishability analysis indicates that SC-ABSE is secure against the chosen-keyword attack (CKA) and keyword secrecy (KS) in the standard model. In addition, user collusion attacks are prevented, and the tamper-proof resistance of data is ensured. Furthermore, security validation is verified by simulating a formal verification scenario using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA), thereby unveiling that SC-ABSE is resistant to man-in-the-middle (MIM) and replay attacks. The experimental analysis utilised real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and utility of SC-ABSE in terms of computa-tion overhead, storage cost and communication overhead. The proposed scheme is also designed and developed to evaluate throughput and latency transactions using a standard benchmark tool known as Caliper. Lastly, simulation results show that SC-ABSE has high throughput and low latency, with an ultimate increase in network life compared with traditional healthcare systems. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

The game involves two players, player 1 (P1) and player 2 (P2). In the first stage, P1 decides whether to trust and let P2 decide, or to secure an egalitarian payoff for both players. If P1 trusts P2, the latter can choose between a symmetric payoff that is double than the secure alternative discarded by P1, and an asymmetric payoff in which P2 earns more than in any other case but makes P1 worse off. Before the main experiment, we obtained participants' scores for Abstract Reasoning (AR), risk attitudes, basic personality characteristics, and specific traits such as psychopathy and impulsivity. During the main experiment, we measured Heart Rate (HR) and ElectroDermal Activity (EDA) variation to account for emotional arousal caused by the decision and feedback processes. Our main findings indicate that, on one hand, P1 trust behavior associates to positive emotionality and, specifically, to the extraversion's warmth facet. In addition, the impulsivity facet of positive urgency also favors trust behavior. No relation to trusting behavior was found for either other major personality aspects or risk attitudes. The physiological results show that participants scoring high in psychopathy exhibit increased EDA and reduced evoked HR deceleration at the moment in which they are asked to decide whether or not to trust. Regarding P2, we find that AR ability and mainly low disagreeable disinhibition favor reciprocal behavior. Specifically, lack of reciprocity significantly relates with a psychopathic, highly disinhibited and impulsive personality. Thus, the present study suggests that personality characteristics would play a significant role in different behaviors underlying cooperation, with extraversion/positive emotionality being more relevant for initiating cooperation, and low disagreeable disinhibition for maintaining it.},

  abstract = {Humans create teams to be more successful in a large variety of tasks. Groups are characterized by an emergent property called collective intelligence, which leads them to be smarter than single individuals. Previous studies proved that collective intelligence characterizes both real and online environments, focusing on adults' performances. In this work, we explored which factors promote group success in an offline and online logical task with adolescents. Five hundred and fifty high school students participated in the experiment and faced Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, first by themselves using the computer, then in a group. Groups interactions could have been computer-mediated or face-to-face, and the participants were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions. Results suggest that groups perform better than singles, regardless of the experimental condition. Among adolescents, online groups performance was negatively affected by participants' average perception of group cohesion, the difficulty of the problem, and the number of communicative exchanges that occur in the interaction. On the contrary, the factors that improve their performances were the average intelligence of the teammates, their levels of neuroticism, and the group heterogeneity in terms of social abilities. This work contributes to the literature with a comprehensive model of collective intelligence among young people. \textcopyright{} 2020 by the authors.},

Not only can the same outcomes be more rewarding if we apply more (not less) effort, sometimes we select options precisely because they require effort.

A survey-based approach was employed to measure privacy attitudes of 685 UK individuals about online data disclosure. Our findings demonstrate that mindfulness contributes to the formation of privacy concerns. A more mindful consumer is more likely to adopt a more objective appraisal style, interpret privacy threats as less threatening, and thus share personal information online. \textcopyright{} 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

  abstract = {Self-esteem, arguably the most important attitudes an individual possesses, has been a premier research topic in psychology for more than a century. Following a surge of interest in implicit attitude measures in the 90s, researchers have tried to assess self-esteem implicitly to circumvent the influence of biases inherent in explicit measures. However, the validity of implicit self-esteem measures remains elusive. Critical tests are often inconclusive, as the validity of such measures is examined in the backdrop of imperfect behavioral measures. To overcome this serious limitation, we tested the neural validity of the most widely used implicit self-esteem measure, the implicit association test (IAT). Given the conceptualization of self-esteem as attitude toward the self, and neuroscience findings that the reward-related brain regions represent an individual's attitude or preference for an object when viewing its image, individual differences in implicit self-esteem should be associated with neural signals in the rewardrelated regions during passive-viewing of self-face (the most obvious representation of the self). Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) on functional MRI (fMRI) data, we demonstrate that the neural signals in the reward-related regions were robustly associated with implicit (but not explicit) self-esteem, thus providing unique evidence for the neural validity of the self-esteem IAT. In addition, both implicit and explicit self-esteem were related, although differently, to neural signals in regions involved in self-processing. Our finding highlights the utility of neuroscience methods in addressing fundamental psychological questions and providing unique insights into important psychological constructs. \textcopyright{} 2018 American Psychological Association 0022-3514/18/\$12.00.},

Not only that, the process is elongated if they are lost, and will contribute to identity theft if unauthorized persons have access to those documents. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to generate a decentralized system, similar to the concept of blockchain, to allow registered persons to access user's personal records. To further elaborate, this system is designed to be used by three consumers, which are: user, authority, and third-party (requester). Nowadays, majority of systems are susceptible to massive data breaches. However, some researches have theorized that blockchain technology may solve this problem, such as one that uses a real-world example, Aadhaar. In conclusion, this project enhances that the area of blockchain identity is vital in helping society gain control of their personal details. Since most of researches are focused on storage system of businesses using blockchain, personal identities of the people should be digitized on the blockchain as well. An identity verification system that is entirely owned by the individual will increase trust that the data is genuine and reliable.},

Studies seem to show poorer calibration for low performers than for high performers, which could indicate worse metacognitive ability among low performers relative to others (the Dunning\textendash Kruger effect). By developing a rational model of self-assessment, we show that such an effect could be produced by two psychological mechanisms, in either isolation or conjunction: influence of prior beliefs about ability or a relation between performance and skill at determining correctness on each problem. To disentangle these explanations, we conducted a large-scale replication of a seminal paper with approximately 4,000 participants in each of two studies. Comparing the predictions of two variants of our rational model provides support for low performers being less able to estimate whether they are correct in the domains of grammar and logical reasoning.},

Such strategies build upon an analysis of the contactor's potential and capabilities (am I able to deliver? am I eligible to participate in the tender?), and the analysis of the economic environment, including the expected behavior of competitors. The tender strategy sets out both the guidelines and the procedure in deciding whether or not to bid as well as the rules for determining the price. The price, on the one hand, should be high enough to cover expected direct and indirect costs as well as risk-adjusted profit. On the other hand, it needs to be low enough to be considered most attractive (typically: the lowest) among the prices offered by the competitors. The paper focuses on the price definition component of the bidding strategy. It provides a brief overview of the existing methods that support bidding decisions by comparing their demand for input and limitations in practical applications and presents a simulation-based method supporting the determination of the profit ratio. This probabilistic method assumes the existence of a positive correlation between the prices offered by the competitors. Its application is illustrated by means of a numerical example. The outcomes of the simulation prompt the amount of the profit margin that maximizes the expected value of the contractor's profit.},

  abstract = {\{\textbackslash em ``How much is my data worth?''\} is an increasingly common question posed by organizations and individuals alike. An answer to this question could allow, for instance, fairly distributing profits among multiple data contributors and determining prospective compensation when data breaches happen. In this paper, we study the problem of \textbackslash emph\{data valuation\} by utilizing the Shapley value, a popular notion of value which originated in coopoerative game theory. The Shapley value defines a unique payoff scheme that satisfies many desiderata for the notion of data value. However, the Shapley value often requires \textbackslash emph\{exponential\} time to compute. To meet this challenge, we propose a repertoire of efficient algorithms for approximating the Shapley value. We also demonstrate the value of each training instance for various benchmark datasets.},

As entertaining as these characters are, they provide us with a window into the dark side of human nature. Instead of treating the dark side of human nature as inherently maladaptive, we provide an alternative view that, despite their costs, traits like these can confer reproductive and survival benefits for the individual. In so doing, we review the research on the Dark Triad traits and provide a theoretical account for how these traits can confer some positive benefits. To facilitate comprehension, we provide examples taken from the media to show how evolutionary psychology and popular culture intersect.},

Rather than uphold claims to privacy, Elahi aims to enact a resistive posture to contemporary techniques of digital surveillance by releasing his personal information. Paradoxically, he voluntarily forgoes his privacy in order to feel more secure. This form of resistance registers his project of self-surveillance as a performance of transparency. In this context, he turns the normative flow of power in digital surveillance into a new critical posture, one in which the artist is anonymous to surveillance systems. Through anonymity, the artist participates with digital surveillance in order to avoid it. By tracing the methodologies that generate data on Elahi's activity, this paper will speculate on how creative interventions can produce resistive strategies against surveillance systems by moving beyond the historical limits of privacy into the outer reaches of anonymity in our contemporary age of transparency.},

In an age of technology integration, this interdependence of data protection is becoming a major threat to privacy. Yet current regulation focuses on the sharing of information between two parties rather than multiactor situations. This study highlights how current policy inadequacies, illustrated by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, can be overcome by means of a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Specifically, the authors introduce a new phenomenological framework to explain interdependent infringements. This framework builds on parallels between property and privacy and suggests that interdependent peer protection necessitates three hierarchical steps, ``the 3Rs'': realize, recognize, and respect. In response to observed failures at these steps, the authors identify four classes of intervention that constitute a toolbox addressing what can be done by marketers, regulators, and privacy organizations. While the first three classes of interventions address issues arising from the corresponding 3Rs, the authors specifically advocate for a fourth class of interventions that proposes radical alternatives that shift the responsibilities for privacy protection away from consumers.},

The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture. Finally, we introduce a new, highly varied and high-quality dataset of human faces.},

Although previous studies have investigated individuals' concerns about information privacy practices, the adverse consequences people associate with external actors accessing their personal information remain unclear. To mitigate customers' fears, organisations need to know which adverse consequences individuals are afraid of and how to address those negative perceptions. To investigate this topic, we conducted 22 focus groups with 119 participants. We developed a comprehensive conceptualisation and categorisation of individuals' perceived adverse consequences of access to their information that includes seven types of consequences: psychological, social, career-related, physical, resource-related, prosecution-related, and freedom-related. Although individuals may limit their interactions with an organisation owing to consequences they associate with both the organisation and other actors, organisations can apply preventive and corrective mechanisms to mitigate some of these negative perceptions. However, organisations' scope of influence is limited and some fears may be mitigated only by individuals themselves or government regulation, if at all.},

Based on qualitative and quantitative studies involving over 1000 participants, we conceptualise and quantify a multidimensional perspective on privacy risks consisting of physical, social, resource-related, psychological, prosecution-related, career-related and freedom-related privacy risks. Our results explicate the prospects of distinguishing privacy risk dimensions by demonstrating how they are differently pronounced across contexts and how technology designs can be tailored to assuage them. Thus, our findings improve the understanding of context and service-specific privacy risks, helping managers to adjust their digital offerings to mitigate users' privacy risk perceptions.},

  month = dec,
  abstract = {As the Internet is becoming a fundamental aspect of the society serving as a de facto platform  for social and business activities, traditional offline activities and services have remarkably  migrated to the web. The presence and interaction of users on these platforms has created a  large amount of digital trace which is being effectively exploited by businesses targeting users on  these platforms. One of the main players in this regard is online advertising which is the underneath  business that drives the majority of the most important online services such as social media,  search engines, map services, etc. This has made online advertising a crucial Internet service in  its own right. While the benefit of using these digital resources has been accepted widely pushing  governments and organizations to improve their Internet coverage, there are major challenges  that limit the society from enjoying their benefits. Together with transparency and privacy, digital  inequality is the main challenge that the society faces today.  In this thesis we propose a set of inexpensive and large scale methodologies that leverages  datasets from online advertising systems to measure and characterize digital inequality on the  web. Our methodologies consider various demographic, geographic and interest categories at  global scale that advances the knowledge of the scientific community to better understand the  challenges in the interplay between online services and users, specifically digital inequalities.  In particular we present three main contributions in this context:  (I) A methodology to measure the price variability assigned to users by the online advertising  system. We created an advertising price comparison system that leverages the bidding  data from four online advertising platforms that contributes to the transparency efforts  to understand the economic value that online advertising system assigns to user profiles.  Using this data we show that advertising price assigned to user profiles varies depending on  the profile of the targeted user.  (II) A methodology to leverage social media data for gender based digital inequality research.  Efforts to understand global prevalence of gender based digital inequality and its  interplay with socioeconomic inequalities are limited by lack of large scale representative  dataset. Towards solving this problem we developed inexpensive methodologies using the  Facebook online advertising platform to quantify the extent of digital inequality in access  to social media and its relation with existing inequality indicators.  (III) A methodology to measure and characterize user representation and growth variability on Facebook. Facebook is the most widely used social media platform connecting billions  of people globally. However, little is known about composition and growth dynamic  of this advertising driven social media giant. The main challenge in measuring these phenomena  is due to lack of large scale representative dataset that describe the actual number  of users and their activities on the social media. We address this problem by leveraging its  online advertising platform to measure and characterize its global composition and growth  based on age, gender, and country of location.  In summary, the work presented in this thesis contributes to advance our knowledge of digital  inequalities measured through social media and to develop methodologies for understanding important  socioeconomic issues based on digital traces from social media and the Internet in general.  It will motivate further research in the area to understand the extent and causes of digital inequalities  in various aspects of the Internet considering different groups of societies. The reported  findings and methodologies will also help lay foundation for informed policy development and  research to close the gender gap and reduce digital inequalities worldwide.},

Conclusions stemming from meta-analyses are often used to direct theory development, calibrate sample size planning, and guide critical decision-making and policymaking. However, meta-analyses can be conflicted, misleading, and irreproducible. One of the reasons for meta-analyses to be misleading is the improper handling ofmeasurement unreliability. Weshow that even when there is no publication bias, the current meta-analysis procedures would frequently detect nonexistent effects, and provide severely biased estimates and intervals with coverage rates far below the intended level. In this study, an effective approach to correcting for unreliability is proposed and evaluated via simulation studies. Its sensitivity to the violation of the homogeneous reliability and residual correlation assumption is also tested. The proposed method is illustrated using a real meta-analysis on the relationship between extroversion and subjective well-being. Substantial differences in meta-analytic results are observed between the proposed method and existing methods. Further, although not specifically designed for aggregating effect sizes with various measures, the proposed method can be used to fulfill the purpose. The study ends with discussions on the limitations and guidelines for implementing the proposed approach. \textcopyright{} 2021 American Psychological Association},

  abstract = {By 6 years, children have a sophisticated adult-like theory of mind that enables them not only to understand the actions of social agents in terms of underlying mental states, but also to distinguish between their own mental states and those of others. Despite this, we argue that even adults do not reliably use this sophisticated ability for the very purpose for which it is designed, to interpret the actions of others. In Experiment 1, a person who played the role of ``director'' in a communication game instructed a participant to move certain objects around in a grid. Before receiving instructions, participants hid an object in a bag, such that they but not the director would know its identity. Occasionally, the descriptions that the director used to refer to a mutually-visible object more closely matched the identity of the object hidden in the bag. Although they clearly knew that the director did not know the identity of the hidden object, they often took it as the referent of the director's description, sometimes even attempting to comply with the instruction by actually moving the bag itself. In Experiment 2 this occurred even when the participants believed that the director had a false belief about the identity of the hidden object, i.e. that she thought that a different object was in the bag. These results show a stark dissociation between an ability to reflectively distinguish one's own beliefs from others', and the routine deployment of this ability in interpreting the actions of others. We propose that this dissociation indicates that important elements of the adult's theory of mind are not fully incorporated into the human comprehension system.},

  abstract = {To make decisions in a social context, humans have to predict the behavior of others, an ability that is thought to rely on having a model of other minds known as ``theory of mind.'' Such a model becomes especially complex when the number of people one simultaneously interacts with is large and actions are anonymous. Here, we present results from a group decision-making task known as the volunteer's dilemma and demonstrate that a Bayesian model based on partially observable Markov decision processes outperforms existing models in quantitatively predicting human behavior and outcomes of group interactions. Our results suggest that in decision-making tasks involving large groups with anonymous members, humans use Bayesian inference to model the ``mind of the group,'' making predictions of others' decisions while also simulating the effects of their own actions on the group's dynamics in the future. A Bayesian model suggests that when interacting with a group, humans simulate the ``mind of the group'' to choose an action.

  abstract = {In the past decade, data privacy, security, and trustworthiness have gained tremendous attention from research communities, and these are still active areas of research with the proliferation of cloud services and social media applications. The data is growing at a rapid pace. It has become an integral part of almost every industry and business, including commercial and non-profit organizations. It often contains person-specific information and a data custodian who holds it must be responsible for managing its use, disclosure, accuracy and privacy protection. In this thesis, we present three research problems. The first two problems address the concerns of stakeholders on privacy protection, data trustworthiness, and profit distribution in the online market for trading person-specific data. The third problem addresses the health information custodians (HICs) concern on privacy-preserving healthcare network data publishing. Our first research problem is identified in cloud-based data integration service where data providers collaborate with their trading partners in order to deliver quality data mining services. Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) enables data integration to serve the demands of data consumers. Data providers face challenges not only to protect private data over the cloud but also to legally adhere to privacy compliance rules when trading person-specific data. We propose a model that allows the collaboration of multiple data providers for integrating their data and derives the contribution of each data provider by valuating the incorporated cost factors. This model serves as a guide for business decision-making, such as estimating the potential privacy risk and finding the sub-optimal value for publishing mashup data. Experiments on real-life data demonstrate that our approach can identify the sub-optimal value in data mashup for different privacy models, including K-anonymity, LKC-privacy, and {$\epsilon$}-differential privacy, with various anonymization algorithms and privacy parameters. Second, consumers demand a good quality of data for accurate analysis and effective decision- making while the data providers intend to maximize their profits by competing with peer providers. In addition, the data providers or custodians must conform to privacy policies to avoid potential penalties for privacy breaches. To address these challenges, we propose a two-fold solution: (1) we present the first information entropy-based trust computation algorithm, IEB\_Trust, that allows a semi-trusted arbitrator to detect the covert behavior of a dishonest data provider and chooses the qualified providers for a data mashup, and (2) we incorporate the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism for the valuation of data providers' attributes into the data mashup process. Experiments on real-life data demonstrate the robustness of our approach in restricting dishonest providers from participation in the data mashup and improving the efficiency in comparison to provenance-based approaches. Furthermore, we derive the monetary shares for the chosen providers from their information utility and trust scores over the differentially private release of the integrated dataset under their joint privacy requirements. Finally, we address the concerns of HICs of exchanging healthcare data to provide better and more timely services while mitigating the risk of exposing patients' sensitive information to privacy threats. We first model a complex healthcare dataset using a heterogeneous information network that consists of multi-type entities and their relationships. We then propose DiffHetNet, an edge-based differentially private algorithm, to protect the sensitive links of patients from inbound and outbound attacks in the heterogeneous health network. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method in terms of information utility and efficiency on different types of real-life datasets that can be modeled as networks. Experimental results suggest that DiffHetNet generally yields less information loss and is significantly more efficient in terms of runtime in comparison with existing network anonymization methods. Furthermore, DiffHetNet is scalable to large network datasets.},

The incentives are usually modeled by payoffs in evolutionary games, such as the prisoners dilemma or the harmony game, with imitation dynamics. Adjusting the incentives by changing the payoff parameters can favor cooperation, as found in the harmony game, over defection, which prevails in the prisoner's dilemma. Here, we show that this is not always the case if individuals engage in strategic interactions in multiple domains. In particular, we investigate evolutionary games on multiplex networks where individuals obtain an aggregate payoff. We explicitly control the strength of degree correlations between nodes in the different layers of the multiplex. We find that if the multiplex is composed of many layers and degree correlations are strong, the topology of the system enslaves the dynamics and the final outcome, cooperation or defection, becomes independent of the payoff parameters. The fate of the system is then determined by the initial conditions.},

Separatist groups repeated more unshared information than synchronous overall. Separatists also repeated more shared information than synchronous groups. Further, groups with a correct minority member also repeated more unshared information than groups with either a majority correct or no correct members.

We conduct two experimental studies (n=243) in which we separately elicit (i) behavior in a public goods game and (ii) normative and empirical expectations of cooperation. In a situation where others' contributions are known, we find a strong norm of conditional cooperation whereby people find it socially appropriate to match others contribution and believe others to comply with such rule of behavior. In contrast, when there is strategic uncertainty regarding others' behavior, empirical and normative expectations diverge substantially. While individuals believe that contributing fully to the public good is the most appropriate action, they expect others to contribute only half of their resources. This renders normative expectations unpredictive for average behavior and underlines the importance of a close alignment of empirical and normative expectations for the influence of social norms on behavior.},

Comparing to the existing literature, we define a pool of possible behaviors for the agents based on the bandits learning algorithms and we highlight settings of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game which may have positive influence on the emergence of cooperation from the aspect of both the entire population and the individual players. We present the level of cooperation and its variation in terms of the median (M) and the interquartile range (IQ) in accordance to the observed topological characteristics of the network structures and partner selection strategies. Our experimental results show that regardless of the underlying network structures, it is difficult to maintain a fully cooperative society in the shade of Random and Epsilon Greedy partner selection strategies. The reported Median values are the lowest and the changes in the IQRs do not follow a sharp increase or decrease in both strategies. Contrary to this, it will even take a shorter time to see a fully cooperative population though UCB, Epsilon First and Epsilon Decreasing strategies. Our observation with respect to different network structures also shows that, considering a certain level of heterogeneity both in terms of distance to others as well as clustering coefficient is more conductive in the spread of cooperative behavior among a networked population.},

In this review, we discuss and critique current operational conceptualizations of what it means for a personality trait to be classified as `dark'. Also discussed is the Dark Core, as well as quantitative issues such as limitations of commonly used statistical treatments, such as multivariate analyses, bifactor modeling, and composite measures, and proposed solutions to some of these issues. Based on a comprehensive and critical appraisal of the literature, future directions are suggested to drive the dark trait field towards a more organized, parsimonious, and productive future. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors},

Using data from a split-ballot experiment in the 1984 General Social Survey involving a variant of Kohn's parental values measure, we test some predictions made by the theory about what kind of response order effect would be expected (a primacy effect) and among which respondents it should be strongest (those low in cognitive sophistication). These predictions are confirmed. We also test the ``form-resistant correlation'' hypothesis. Although correlations between items are altered by changes m response order, the presence and nature of the latent value dimension underlying these responses is essentially unaffected.},

Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

Method: A cross-sectional correlational design was followed, examining multiple linear regression models. A total sample of 197 Greek adults (64\% women, M=35.13 years old) completed a one-shot simulated PDGs, the Dirty Dozen scale, the Barratt Impulsivity Scale and the Honesty-Humility subscale from the HEXACO NEO-PI. Results: Significant correlations between Dirty Dozen scores and Impulsivity, and Dirty Dozen scores and Honesty-Humility (p{$<$}.01) where identified. Honesty-Humility predicted Dark Triad scores (p{$<$}.01). Dark Triad scores predicted the classification of participants in groups, according to their decision in the first PDG simulation (p{$<$}.01), while Honesty/Humility and Impulsivity were not significant predictors. Conclusions: Simulated social situations can serve as situational judgment tests in an effort to develop new measures of personality and a better understanding in the underpinning mechanisms between personality traits and intended behavior in ethical dilemmas and moral judgment.},

We hypothesized that a lack of sustainability stems from insufficient intergenerational mentalizing (i.e., taking the perspective of people in the future). To causally test our hypothesis, we applied high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). We tested participants twice (receiving stimulation at the TPJ or the vertex as control), while they engaged in a behavioral economic paradigm measuring sustainable decision-making, even if sustainability was costly. Indeed, excitatory anodal HD-tDCS increased sustainable decision-making, while inhibitory cathodal HD-tDCS had no effect. These finding cannot be explained by changes in participants' fairness norms or their estimation of how other people would behave. Shedding light on the neural basis of sustainability, our results could inspire targeted interventions tackling the TPJ and give neuroscientific support to theories on how to construct public campaigns addressing sustainability issues. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Author(s)},

For reasons that will be discussed below, many researchers find it desirable (or even necessary) to retain the placebo condition in the design, and place great weight on the results of the contrast between placebo and standard. Thus, the first jump in the evolution of clinical trials design has usually been the ``three cell'' design (two actives and a placebo cell).},

Consistent with the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE), deindividuation fostered group identification with the partners and induced greater opinion polarization, partly by heightening concerns about public evaluations. Although participants rated the partners' arguments more positively when they identified with the partners, perceived argument quality did not significantly affect postdiscussion opinion shift. Deindividuation did not lower private-self-awareness, nor did private-self-awareness significantly influence opinion polarization. Implications are discussed in light of SIDE and the referent informational influence theory.},

  abstract = {Current practices recommend placing a self-rated health question before specific health items in survey questionnaires to minimize potential order effects. Because this recommendation is based on data collected in English, its applicability to other languages is unknown. This study examines whether there is an order effect associated with self-rated health for interviews conducted in English and Spanish languages. An experiment was conducted by using the 2007 California Health Interview Survey, where questions on self-rated health were inserted in 1 of 2 locations: preceding and following question items on specific chronic conditions. Respondents were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 versions of the locations by the split-half method. Although no order effect was present in the English interviews, the authors found a significant and large effect with Spanish interviews: Self-rated health appeared much worse when asked before chronic conditions than when asked after them. This order effect was larger among females than males. Order effects for self-rated health differ by interview language; inferences about the health status of Spanish-speaking populations (and potentially Latinos) depend on question order. If maintaining comparability is important, the authors' finding contradicts current recommendations, as inserting the self-rated health question before specific questions led to larger differences in health status between English and Spanish speakers.},

  abstract = {Game theory provides a solution to the problem of finding a set of optimal decision-making strategies in a group. However, people seldom play such optimal strategies and adjust their strategies based on their experience. Accordingly, many theories postulate a set of variables related to the probabilities of choosing various strategies and describe how such variables are dynamically updated. In reinforcement learning, these value functions are updated based on the outcome of the player's choice, whereas belief learning allows the value functions of all available choices to be updated according to the choices of other players. We investigated the nature of learning process in monkeys playing a competitive game with ternary choices, using a rock\textendash paper\textendash scissors game. During the baseline condition in which the computer selected its targets randomly, each animal displayed biases towards some targets. When the computer exploited the pattern of animal's choice sequence but not its reward history, the animal's choice was still systematically biased by the previous choice of the computer. This bias was reduced when the computer exploited both the choice and reward histories of the animal. Compared to simple models of reinforcement learning or belief learning, these adaptive processes were better described by a model that incorporated the features of both models. These results suggest that stochastic decision-making strategies in primates during social interactions might be adjusted according to both actual and hypothetical payoffs.},

A self-administered online consumer survey was conducted using a South Korean sample comprising those with experience using LBMC, and data from 517 respondents were analyzed. Using cluster analysis, consumers were categorized into four groups according to their responses regarding perceived personalization benefits and privacy risks: indifferent (n = 87), personalization oriented (n = 113), privacy oriented (n = 152), and ambivalent (n = 165). The results revealed significant differences across consumer groups in the antecedents and outcomes of the personalization\textendash privacy paradox. Multiple regression analysis showed that factors influence the two outcome variables of the personalization\textendash privacy paradox: internal conflict (psychological outcome) and continued use intention of LBMC (behavioral outcome). In conclusion, this study showed that consumer involvement, self-efficacy, and technology optimism significantly affected both outcome variables, whereas technology insecurity influenced internal conflict, and consumer trust influenced continued use intention. This study contributes to the current literature and provides practical implications for marketers and retailers aiming to succeed in the mobile commerce environment.},

These challenges can and should be addressed by the joint efforts of a wide range of stakeholders from the public and private sector. The advancement of IoT depends in part on how policymakers respond to the opportunities and challenges associated with it. This research aims to identify the potential roles for the government in fostering the advancement of IoT innovation and adoption. To this end, we analyze data collected from 177 documents of public comments submitted to the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration and from a focus group discussion with senior managers.

In line with the earlier results, we found that respondents rated their social status lower in the pyramid than in the ladder condition. No differences between the two layouts were found regarding response effort, however, the ladder layout was associated with higher criterion validity.

Experiments on confidence reports have almost exclusively focused on two-alternative decision-making. In this realm, the leading theory is that confidence reflects the probability that a decision is correct (the posterior probability of the chosen option). There is, however, another possibility, namely that people are less confident if the best two options are closer to each other in posterior probability, regardless of how probable they are in absolute terms. This possibility has not previously been considered because in two-alternative decisions, it reduces to the leading theory. Here, we test this alternative theory in a three-alternative visual categorization task. We found that confidence reports are best explained by the difference between the posterior probabilities of the best and the next-best options, rather than by the posterior probability of the chosen (best) option alone, or by the overall uncertainty (entropy) of the posterior distribution. Our results upend the leading notion of decision confidence and instead suggest that confidence reflects the observer's subjective probability that they made the best possible decision.},

Traditional research has focused on static structures, and yet most real interactions are finite in duration and changing in time, forming a temporal network. This raises the question of whether cooperation can emerge and persist despite an intrinsically fragmented population structure. Here we develop a framework to study the evolution of cooperation on temporal networks. Surprisingly, we find that network temporality actually enhances the evolution of cooperation relative to comparable static networks, despite the fact that bursty interaction patterns generally impede cooperation. We resolve this tension by proposing a measure to quantify the amount of temporality in a network, revealing an intermediate level that maximally boosts cooperation. Our results open a new avenue for investigating the evolution of cooperation and other emergent behaviours in more realistic structured populations.},

This is especially important in spaces where privacy violations put people, particularly marginalized individuals, at risk for online harassment and abuse, among other harms. We seek to intervene in online research practices by putting forth a feminist approach to privacy, drawing on two studies related to online harassment. Specifically, we argue that feminist theory and methodology inform an approach to privacy that (a) starts from the lives of socially and politically vulnerable groups, (b) takes an intersectional approach to analyzing power relations, and (c) draws on a moral imperative of care and responsibility in enacting feminist principles of context, dialogue, and reflexivity throughout the research process.

However, human decision making in real life usually involves different strategies and behavioral trajectories that lead to the same empirical outcome. Motivated by clinical literature of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, we propose here a more general and flexible parametric framework for sequential decision making that involves a two-stream reward processing mechanism. We demonstrated that this framework is flexible and unified enough to incorporate a family of problems spanning multi-armed bandits (MAB), contextual bandits (CB) and reinforcement learning (RL), which decompose the sequential decision making process in different levels. Inspired by the known reward processing abnormalities of many mental disorders, our clinically-inspired agents demonstrated interesting behavioral trajectories and comparable performance on simulated tasks with particular reward distributions, a real-world dataset capturing human decision-making in gambling tasks, and the PacMan game across different reward stationarities in a lifelong learning setting (The codes to reproduce all the experimental results can be accessed at https://github.com/doerlbh/mentalRL.).},

We propose to study online learning algorithm behavior in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game, where we explored the full spectrum of reinforcement learning agents: multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits and reinforcement learning. We have evaluate them based on a tournament of iterated prisoner's dilemma where multiple agents can compete in a sequential fashion. This allows us to analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested independent reward-driven agents, and also allows us study the capacity of these algorithms to fit the human behaviors. Results suggest that considering the current situation to make decision is the worst in this kind of social dilemma game.

  abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become one of the major platforms for social interactions, such as building up relationship, sharing personal experiences, and providing other services. The wide adoption of OSNs raises privacy concerns due to personal data shared online. Privacy control mechanisms have been deployed in popular OSNs for users to determine who can view their personal information. However, user's sensitive information could still be leaked even when privacy rules are properly configured. We investigate the effectiveness of privacy control mechanisms against privacy leakage from the perspective of information flow. Our analysis reveals that the existing privacy control mechanisms do not protect the flow of personal information effectively. By examining representative OSNs including Facebook, Google+, and Twitter, we discover a series of privacy exploits. We find that most of these exploits are inherent due to the conflicts between privacy control and OSN functionalities. The conflicts reveal that the effectiveness of privacy control may not be guaranteed as most OSN users expect. We provide remedies for OSN users to mitigate the risk of involuntary information leakage in OSNs. Finally, we discuss the costs and implications of resolving the privacy exploits.},

A grounded theory methodology and an abductive analysis were used to identify patterns in the findings and construct a new taxonomy of online information-sharing behaviours: contrary to existing taxonomies, all participants in this study are very privacy aware and make quite deliberate choices about what personal information they share online, with whom, to what extent, and under what circumstances. Four distinctive classifications of people's online information-sharing behaviours were derived from this study: privacy pragmatists, privacy victims, privacy optimists, and privacy fatalists. \textcopyright{} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Users often learn from others through a social learning process before making decisions related an information contribution or purchase on social commerce sites. Despite the extensive literature on social learning, there is a research gap regarding the impact of various sources on user information sharing behaviors. A majority of the previous studies examined the impact of social learning information from the perspective of friends or other sources (e.g., opinion leaders or friends) without considering their relative impact among different sources. We will conduct a field study and analyze a large-scale data collected from a social commerce site. We expect that friend-network information (i.e., friends' purchase behavior and friends' sharing behavior) and opinion leader-network information (i.e., opinion leaders' purchase behavior and opinion leaders' sharing behavior) have similar effect on user information sharing behavior. Follower-network information has a greatest influence on user information sharing behavior relative to the friend-network information and opinion leader-network information. In addition, the number of followers has a non-linear relationship with user information sharing behavior. This study has important implications for both theory and practice.},

Previous research has focused on well-mixed structures, and yet most individuals in real interactions have sentiments and unequal status in duration and changing in time. This raises the question of whether cooperation can persist despite different sentiments and unequal status of individuals. In this paper, sentiments are included the positive and the negative, and unequal statues are the small node and the big node based the node degree. We develop a game model to study cooperative behaviors based unequal statuses and sentiments, and experimentally examine the model by digital and real networks. Surprisingly, we find that small nodes are more prone to choose positive cooperation relative to comparable big nodes on the promise of enough profits of the tacit knowledge and the excess return. Our results reveal that the unequal status is the hidden mechanism for cooperative behaviors, and provide a new prospective to investigate the evolution of cooperation in more realistic environments. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

This test began with recording, transcribing, and subjectively scoring participants' verbal descriptions, which consistently found ToM-specific difficulties in ASD. More recently in 2011, White et al. created a more objective version of this ToM test using multiple-choice questions. However, there has been surprisingly little uptake of this test, hence it is currently unclear if White et al.'s findings replicate. Further, the lack of an online version of the test may be hampering its use in large-scale studies and outside of research settings. Addressing these issues, we report the development of a web-based version of the Frith\textendash Happ\'e Animations Test for autistic and neurotypical adults. An online version of the test was developed in a large general population sample (study 1; N = 285) and online data were compared with those collected in a lab-based setting (study 2; N = 339). The new online test was then administered to adults with a clinical diagnosis of ASD and matched neurotypical controls (study 3; N = 231). Results demonstrated that the test could successfully be administered online to autistic adults, who showed ToM difficulties compared to neurotypical adults, replicating White et al.'s findings. Overall, we have developed a quicker, more objective, and web-based version of the Frith\textendash Happ\'e Animations Test that will be useful for social cognition research within and beyond the field of autism, with potential utility for clinical settings.},

The present study showed stronger evidence than past studies have done that confidence level is reduced when probability information is missing. A transfer phase, where the subjects were tested in the positive-framed first and then in the negative-framed condition or vice-versa, showed that the initial frame continues to influence confidence responses of a given subject despite a subsequent change in the frame.

Therefore, a user must be willing to provide his or her information to the SNS in order for others to find and "befriend" him or her and vice versa. Results from an online survey was used to test a trust-risk model of information disclosure in which two dispositional factors (Internet privacy concern and locus of control) and one situational factor (salience of SNS in daily life) were hypothesized to influence perceived risk regarding SNSs in general and trust in a SNS in particular. All proposed hypotheses were found significant, suggesting that the dispositional and situational factors are potentially salient in the SNS context. Findings also suggest that perhaps providing completed categories of personal information may be more sensitive than individual pieces of information alone.}

We discuss the need to re-examine our understanding of information technology and information system (IS) artefacts and to expand the range of the latter to include those artificial phenomena that are crucial to information security and privacy research. We then briefly discuss some prevalent limitations in theory, methodology, and contributions that generally weaken security/privacy studies and jeopardise their chances of publication in a top IS journal. More importantly, we suggest remedies for these weaknesses, identifying specific improvements that can be made and offering a couple of illustrations of such improvements. In particular, we address the notion of loose re-contextualisation, using deterrence theory research as an example. We also provide an illustration of how the focus on intentions may have resulted in an underuse of powerful theories in security and privacy research, because such theories explain more than just intentions. We then outline three promising opportunities for IS research that should be particularly compelling to security and privacy researchers: online platforms, the Internet of things, and big data. All of these carry innate information security and privacy risks and vulnerabilities that can be addressed only by researching each link of the systems chain, that is, technologies\textendash policies\textendash processes\textendash people\textendash society\textendash economy\textendash legislature. We conclude by suggesting several specific opportunities for new research in these areas.},

Past research has demonstrated the structure of social network as well as the existence of zealots can induce some phenomena like information gerrymandering. However, the networks in social context are not static all the time, which raises the question of how opinion forms on the temporal network and how zealots influence the process of opinion formation. In this study, we investigate two scenarios of opinion formation, innovation eruption and election. For the former, we carry out some theoretical analysis based on activity-driven model and find that the existence of zealots will keep the negative opinion, which zealots hold, alive among the population. Then for the election scenario, simulations are performed both on real-world data and synthetic data. We find that the case of temporal network can weaken the effect of the zealots compared with the case of static network, and that the intensity of the effect depends on the connectivity of temporal networks. Comparing with aggregated networks, the temporal network influence the effect of zealots depending on the time interval of the temporal network.},

  abstract = {Accurately estimating consumer demand for new products is an arduous task made even more difficult by the fact that individuals tend to overstate the amount they are willing to pay for new goods when asked hypothetical questions. Despite their appeal in eliminating hypothetical bias, marketers have been slow to adopt experimental auctions as a standard tool in pre-test market research. One issue that has slowed adoption of the methodology is the proliferation of auction mechanisms and the lack of clear guidance in choosing between mechanisms. In this paper, we provide insight into the theoretical properties of two incentive compatible value elicitation mechanisms, the BDM and Vickrey 2nd price auction, such that practitioners can make more informed decisions in designing experimental auctions to determine consumer willingness-to-pay. In particular, we draw attention to the shapes of the payoff functions and show in a simulation that the two mechanisms differ with respect to the expected cost of deviating from truthful bidding. We show that incentives for truthful bidding depend on the distribution of competing bidders' values and/or prices and individuals' true values for a good. The simulation indicates the 2nd price auction punishes deviations from truthful bidding more severely for high value individuals than the BDM mechanism. These results are confirmed by an experimental study, where we find more accurate bidding for high-value individuals in the 2nd price auction as compared to the BDM. Our results also indicate that when implementing the BDM mechanism, the greatest incentives for truthful value revelation are created when the random price generator is based on a normal distribution centered on an individual's expected true value.},

Parents of children with Prader-Willi syndrome exhibited a hedonic bias by attributing their child's success to internal factors (particularly when the child was good at puzzles), downplayed the role of chance when their child had higher puzzle skills and higher cognitive functioning, and differentiated between internal and external attributions. In contrast, parents of children with Williams syndrome showed an inconsistent attributional pattern. These findings help identify how parents understand the intellectual performance of their child with disabilities and how interventions might be beneficial.},

  abstract = {A social network is a group of individuals having some pattern of interactions between them. Social network analysis is used to study such social structures by identifying local and global patterns, locating influential entities and examining network dynamics. Social networks evolve over time. Individuals create and deactivate social ties, thereby altering the structure of the social network in which they participate. Most of the social networks display patterns of interaction between their elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random. Such networks are called complex networks. Two well-known classes of complex networks are scale-free networks and small-world networks. A number of random graph models are available which can be used to represent these two classes of a complex network effectively. The Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model generates scale-free networks and the Watts-Strogatz model produces networks having small-world properties. The paper studies Facebook network using the Barabasi-Albert model and the Watts-Strogatz model. The average centralities, the clustering coefficient and the degree-distribution have been obtained for the respective random graph models and then compared with that of the original graph. To enhance this comparative study, the classical Erdos-Renyi random graph model, which generates a purely random graph, has also been used.},

We developed a metric for estimating how participants weight their partner's opinion relative to their own and compared this weighting to an optimal benchmark. Replicated across three countries (Denmark, Iran, and China), we show that participants assigned nearly equal weights to each other's opinions regardless of true differences in their competence\textemdash even when informed by explicit feedback about their competence gap or under monetary incentives to maximize collective accuracy. This equality bias, whereby people behave as if they are as good or as bad as their partner, is particularly costly for a group when a competence gap separates its members.},

In this environment, players are given an endowment of tokens and faced with a choice between cooperation and defection. In the present study a prisoner's dilemma game was administrated to individuals (N = 280), along with measures of Dark Triad and impulsivity. Dark Triad variables were found to predict the likelihood of defection in the prisoner's dilemma. Specifically, high levels of psychopathy coupled with high impulsivity may better describe a person who repeatedly attempts to extract defection. Defection was also more likely for individuals who scored higher on the Machiavellianism domain. Although Machiavellianism is also linked to higher defection, it has no association with impulsivity, but, rather, is associated with strategy and long-term planning. Interestingly, individuals high in narcissism with their entitlement and over-confidence had no significant effect on defection in such a game. Overall, the study suggests that two dark personality traits can be a significant predictor of behaviour in the prisoner's dilemma. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Along with the Short Dark Triad measure, participants (N = 284) completed a social discounting task in which they were asked to make choices between a hypothetical amount of money to keep for themselves and a hypothetical amount of money to share with a specified number of people. They also competed a delay discounting task, in which they were asked to make choices between immediate small outcomes and delayed bigger outcomes. To probe the unique contribution of three Dark Triad traits predicting both discounting types, we conducted separated multiple linear regression analyses. The study revealed that the higher one's psychopathy and Machiavellianism, the greater one's social discounting, indicating more selfishness and lack of willingness to share with other people. On the other hand, the higher one's narcissism, the smaller one's social discounting, indicating more willingness to share. These findings place in doubt the selfishness of narcissism. Second, in case of delay discounting, only psychopathy and narcissism predicted steep delay discounting, suggesting that individuals who score high in psychopathy and narcissism tend to obtain rather immediate outcomes. Also, Machiavellianism was not significantly associated with delay discounting. Finally, a positive correlation was observed between delay and social discounting. The results indicated that social discounting was related to, but not equivalent to, delay discounting. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions\textemdash namely, collection, control, and awareness\textemdash exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy. In addition, we found that the causal model centering on IUIPC fits the data satisfactorily and explains a large amount of variance in behavioral intention, suggesting that the proposed model will serve as a useful tool for analyzing online consumers' reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet.},

Presently, the patients do not have control over the access privileges to their medical records and remain unaware of the true value of the data they have. In this paper, we provide an overview of the next-generation artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies and present innovative solutions that may be used to accelerate the biomedical research and enable patients with new tools to control and profit from their personal data as well with the incentives to undergo constant health monitoring. We introduce new concepts to appraise and evaluate personal records, including the combination-, time- and relationship-value of the data. We also present a roadmap for a blockchain-enabled decentralized personal health data ecosystem to enable novel approaches for drug discovery, biomarker development, and preventative healthcare. A secure and transparent distributed personal data marketplace utilizing blockchain and deep learning technologies may be able to resolve the challenges faced by the regulators and return the control over personal data including medical records back to the individuals.},

Relative to middle-class counterparts, lower/working-class individuals are less likely to define themselves in terms of their socioeconomic status and are more likely to have interdependent self-concepts; they are also more inclined to explain social events in situational terms, as a result of having a lower sense of personal control. Working-class people score higher on measures of empathy and are more likely to help others in distress. The widely held view that working-class individuals are more prejudiced towards immigrants and ethnic minorities is shown to be a function of economic threat, in that highly educated people also express prejudice towards these groups when the latter are described as highly educated and therefore pose an economic threat. The fact that middle-class norms of independence prevail in universities and prestigious workplaces makes working-class people less likely to apply for positions in such institutions, less likely to be selected and less likely to stay if selected. In other words, social class differences in identity, cognition, feelings, and behaviour make it less likely that working-class individuals can benefit from educational and occupational opportunities to improve their material circumstances. This means that redistributive policies are needed to break the cycle of deprivation that limits opportunities and threatens social cohesion.},

Contrary to the privacy paradox, the results here suggest consumers retain strong privacy expectations even after disclosing information. Privacy violations are valued akin to security violations in creating distrust in firms and in consumer (un)willingness to engage with firms. This paper broadens the scope of corporate responsibility to suggest firms have a positive obligation to identify reasonable expectations of privacy of consumers. In addition, research perpetuating the privacy paradox, through the mistaken framing of disclosure as proof of anti-privacy behavior, gives license to firms to act contrary to the interests of consumers.},

Both treatments were divided into three stages: in the first stage the only available information was a reference price for the tomatoes. In stages 2 and 3 we revealed the local origin and the organic grown of the tomatoes respectively. Our results show that in the auction the percentage of participants willing to pay the same or more than the reference price was between 20 and 30\%. In the CV method this percentage was between 40 and 65\%. The mean WTP in the auction, considering the whole of the individuals, was situated between 1.90 and 2.13 \texteuro/kg. These same results obtained through the CV were situated between 2.54 and 3.21 \texteuro/kg. The results confirmed the findings of previous papers in which the hypothetical bias of CV was clarified because it yields higher values for WTP than the auction, especially when referring to the number of individuals willing to pay more. Additionally, hedonic price models were estimated for the prices obtained by both methods with the result that in all the models, WTP was directly related to the price paid for the latest purchase of tomatoes.},

Significantly, many participants were mistrustful of both governmental and corporate actors. Participants displayed awareness of privacy risks, but frequently mischaracterized the extent to which information could be aggregated and mined.

  abstract = {Whilst the rapid advancement of technology in the 21st century has facilitated the online collection, storage, retrieval, manipulation, and transmission of individuals' personal information, it has also led to a concomitant rise in privacy concerns amongst e-commerce users. Although privacy concerns have received considerable attention in the e-commerce literature, to date, empirical research has tended to report somewhat erratic and inconsistent findings in the context of consumer privacy. Accordingly, the relationships between the antecedents, privacy concerns, and the outcome variables in e-commerce contexts remains unclear. To remedy such deficiencies in the literature, this study adopts the meta-analytic approach to gather and make sense of the inconsistent and mixed empirical findings reported in the literature. The findings show that risk perceptions trigger privacy concerns while benefit perceptions, familiarity, reputation, privacy policy, and trust mitigate privacy concerns which in turn affect customer attitude and usage of e-commerce platforms. To investigate the possible reasons for inconsistent findings, we performed a moderation analysis which suggests that methodological moderators, that is, type of article, research methods, and sample type; and contextual moderators, i.e. country where the study was carried out, and gender dominance in a sample set, can cause inconsistencies in the findings. Theoretically, this meta-analysis contributes to the Antecedents; Privacy Concerns; Outcome variables (APCO) Model, and the literature on consumer privacy in the context of e-commerce. Practically, the findings provide guidelines to e-commerce businesses to effectively address customers' privacy concerns.},

We discuss how the increasingly blurred lines between public and private information, and the continuation of the outdated practices of notice and consent, challenge traditional conceptualizations of privacy in the context of psychological targeting. Drawing on the theory of contextual integrity, we argue that it is time to rethink privacy and move beyond the questions of who collects what data to how the data are being used. Finally, we suggest that regulations of psychological targeting should be accompanied by a mindset that fosters (1) privacy by design to make it easy for individuals to act in line with their privacy goals, as well as (2) disclosure by choice, to allow individuals to freely decide whether and when they might be willing to forsake their privacy for better service.},

Data quality is compared based on five indicators: (a) completion rates, (b) response order effects, (c) social desirability, (d) non-substantive responses, and (e) length of open answers. I hypothesized that mobile web surveys would result in lower completion rates, stronger response order effects, and less elaborate answers to open-ended questions. No difference was expected in the level of reporting in sensitive items and in the rate of non-substantive responses. To test the assumptions, an experiment with two survey modes was conducted using a volunteer online access panel in Russia. As expected, mobile web was associated with a lower completion rate, shorter length of open answers, and similar level of socially undesirable and non-substantive responses. However, no stronger primacy effects in mobile web survey mode were found.},

The amount of data generated by Internet users poses great opportunities and significant challenges for political scientists.

Pervasive digital tracking and profiling, in combination with personaliza-tion, have become a powerful toolset for systematically influencing user behaviour. When used in political campaigns or in other efforts to shape public policy, privacy issues intertwine with electoral outcomes. The practice of targeting voters with personalized messages adapted to their personality and political views, has already raised debates about political manipulation; however, studies focus-ing on privacy are still scarce. Focusing on the democracy aspects and identifying the threats to privacy stemming from the use of big data technologies for political purposes, this paper identifies long-term privacy implications which may undermine fundamental features of democracy such as fair elections and political equality of all citizens.

Yet, most real-world social behaviors involve dynamic, coevolving decisions by interacting agents, which poses challenges for creating tractable models of behavior. Here, using a game in which humans competed against both real and artificial opponents, we show that it is possible to quantify the instantaneous dynamic coupling between agents. Adopting a reinforcement learning approach, we use Gaussian Processes to model the policy and value functions of participants as a function of both game state and opponent identity. We found that higher-scoring participants timed their final change in direction to moments when the opponent's counter-strategy was weaker, while lower-scoring participants less precisely timed their final moves. This approach offers a natural set of metrics for facilitating analysis at multiple timescales and suggests new classes of experimental paradigms for assessing behavior. \textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s).},

However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10\%\textendash 12\% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses. Recommendations include using identified rather than anonymous responses, incorporating instructed response items before data collection, as well as computing consistency indices and multivariate outlier analysis to ensure high-quality data.},

However, even if they could provide an explanation for the emergence and stability of cooperation in modern societies, they are not able to reproduce some key features observed in social and economical interactions. The typical shape of wealth distribution - known as Pareto Law - and the microscopic organization of wealth production are two of them. Here, we introduce a modification to the classical formulation of Public Goods Games that allows for the emergence of both of these features from first principles. Unlike traditional Public Goods Games on networks, where players contribute equally to all the games in which they participate, we allow individuals to redistribute their contribution according to what they earned in previous rounds. Results from numerical simulations show that not only a Pareto distribution for the payoffs naturally emerges but also that if players don't invest enough in one round they can act as defectors even if they are formally cooperators. Finally, we also show that the players self-organize in a very productive backbone that covers almost perfectly the minimum spanning tree of the underlying interaction network. Our results not only give an explanation for the presence of the wealth heterogeneity observed in real data but also points to a conceptual change regarding how cooperation is defined in collective dilemmas.},

Meanwhile, we implement the utility interdependency by integrating the payoff correlations between two lattices. Extensive simulations indicate that the optimal density of influential players exists for the cooperation to be promoted, and can be further facilitated through the utility coupling. Current results are beneficial to understanding the origin of cooperation among selfish agents among realistic scenarios.},

  abstract = {Background: It has repeatedly been reported that, when making decisions under uncertainty, groups outperform individuals. Real groups are often replaced by simulated groups: Instead of performing an actual group discussion, individual responses are aggregated by a numerical computation. While studies have typically used unweighted majority voting (MV) for this aggregation, the theoretically optimal method is confidence weighted majority voting (CWMV)\textemdash if independent and accurate confidence ratings from the individual group members are available. To determine which simulations (MV vs. CWMV) reflect real group processes better, we applied formal cognitive modeling and compared simulated group responses to real group responses. Results: Simulated group decisions based on CWMV matched the accuracy of real group decisions, while simulated group decisions based on MV showed lower accuracy. CWMV predicted the confidence that groups put into their group decisions well. However, real groups treated individual votes to some extent more equally weighted than suggested by CWMV. Additionally, real groups tend to put lower confidence into their decisions compared to CWMV simulations. Conclusion: Our results highlight the importance of taking individual confidences into account when simulating group decisions: We found that real groups can aggregate individual confidences in a way that matches statistical aggregations given by CWMV to some extent. This implies that research using simulated group decisions should use CWMV instead of MV as a benchmark to compare real groups to. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The Privacy Calculus theory states that individuals always rationally weigh the potential benefits and potential risks of data disclosure decisions. The rational assumption, however, often turns out to be wrong. The scientific literature has identified some influencing factors. These can be, for example, emotions or the current mood. In addition, there are thinking styles such as the need for cognition or faith into intuition. Also, the framing of a message, status quo bias, anchoring effect, positivity bias, or peer pressure (herding effects and affective commitment) can lead to irrational data disclosure decisions. The trustworthiness and reputation (in particular the possibly resulting halo effect) can additionally lead to decisions with little cognitive effort. To identify contextual adjustments of the Privacy Calculus theory, expert interviews were conducted with ten Internet users. Respondents feel well informed about the potential benefits, but not about risks. However, information is often difficult to read, too long or not clear. Rational data disclosure decisions are more likely to be made in sensitive contexts (e.g. finance or health care), and irrational decisions tend to be made in less-sensitive contexts (e.g. social networks or e-commerce), with respondents focusing primarily on emotions, peer pressure, or trust and reputation. To investigate the impact of Privacy Calculus decisions on firm performance, a survey was conducted with 12 internet firms. Most companies explicitly consider privacy-specific characteristics when designing their products, but more likely to show the benefits than the risks of data disclosure. The Privacy Calculus theory is almost completely unknown in practice. However, if it is known, it will also be used to develop the privacy policy, business strategy and business model. However, most companies do not see an impact of Privacy Calculus decisions on firm performance.},

  abstract = {Background The ownership of patient information in the context of big data is a relatively new problem, which is not yet fully recognized by the medical academic community. The problem is interdisciplinary, incorporating legal, ethical, medical, and aspects of information and communication technologies, requiring a sophisticated analysis. However, no previous scoping review has mapped existing studies on the subject. Objective This study aims to map and assess published studies on patient data ownership in the context of big data as viewed by the academic community. Methods A scoping review was conducted based on the 5-stage framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley and further developed by Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien. The organization and reporting of results of the scoping review were conducted according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and its extensions for Scoping Reviews). A systematic and comprehensive search of 4 scientific information databases, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Springer, was performed for studies published between January 2000 and October 2019. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies and the extracted data. Results The review included 32 eligible articles authored by academicians that correspond to 3 focus areas: problem (ownership), area (health care), and context (big data). Five major aspects were studied: the scientific area of publications, aspects and academicians' perception of ownership in the context of big data, proposed solutions, and practical applications for data ownership issues in the context of big data. The aspects in which publications consider ownership of medical data are not clearly distinguished but can be summarized as ethical, legal, political, and managerial. The ownership of patient data is perceived primarily as a challenge fundamental to conducting medical research, including data sales and sharing, and to a lesser degree as a means of control, problem, threat, and opportunity also in view of medical research. Although numerous solutions falling into 3 categories, technology, law, and policy, were proposed, only 3 real applications were discussed. Conclusions The issue of ownership of patient information in the context of big data is poorly researched; it is not addressed consistently and in its integrity, and there is no consensus on policy decisions and the necessary legal regulations. Future research should investigate the issue of ownership as a core research question and not as a minor fragment among other topics. More research is needed to increase the body of knowledge regarding the development of adequate policies and relevant legal frameworks in compliance with ethical standards. The combined efforts of multidisciplinary academic teams are needed to overcome existing gaps in the perception of ownership, the aspects of ownership, and the possible solutions to patient data ownership issues in the reality of big data.},

This phenomenon of contradictory privacy-related decisions is referred to as the privacy paradox. Researchers have explained privacy paradox as either a rational function resultant of a calculus of costs and benefits, or due to the effects of emotions (affect), psychological deviations and cognitive biases. However, the nature of mental perceptions in privacy have not been properly examined. This study investigates the nature of mental perceptions formed in a given privacy-related situation and their influence on privacy-related decision-making in the context of e-commerce. We argue that individuals' privacy-related decisions are based on mental perceptions formed during privacy-related situations that are both rational and emotional, as well as, interconnected with one-another. Based on the privacy calculus and the findings of neuroscience, we developed the research model and subsequently evaluated it using two within-subject experiments using an EEG device. The results of the study indicate that individuals' privacy-related decisions tap into both executive and emotional areas of the brain, which involves assessments of risks and rewards, as well as, emotional regulation.},

In the first chapter, I investigate if an individual is more likely to behave corruptly if she believes that the majority of his/her peers are behaving in a similar manner. I also study what motivates an individual to follow the behavior of others more: knowing that the majority behaves corruptly or the willingness to fulfill the expectations of one's peers. I use a one-shot reverse public goods experiment to provide answers to these questions. The results suggest the existence of a peer effect of corrupt behavior. Expectations of the number of corrupt peers are found to be the main source of subjects' anti-social behavior. In the second chapter, I question the rationale behind previous research results on the relationship between officials' wages and the level of corruption. In the light of counterintuitive empirical findings by Schulze et al. (2016) and Chen and Liu (2018), I investigate the wages- corruption relationship by means of a laboratory experiment, using a robust version of a bribery game with four different relative wages for public officials.

This phenomenon has yet to be directly explored in episodic memory, nor explored for physiological correlates or reaction times. We designed a novel method to elicit the DKE via a test of item recognition while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Throughout the task, participants were asked to estimate the percentile in which they performed compared to others. Results revealed participants in the bottom 25th percentile over-estimated their percentile, while participants in the top 75th percentile under-estimated their percentile, exhibiting the classic DKE. Reaction time measures revealed a condition-by-group interaction whereby over-estimators responded faster than under-estimators when estimating being in the top percentile and responded slower when estimating being in the bottom percentile. Between-group EEG differences were evident between over-estimators and under-estimators during Dunning\textendash Kruger responses, which revealed FN400-like effects of familiarity supporting differences for over-estimators, whereas ``old-new'' memory event-related potential effects revealed a late parietal component associated with recollection-based processing for under-estimators that was not evident for over-estimators. Findings suggest over- and under-estimators use differing cognitive processes when assessing their performance, such that under-estimators may rely on recollection during memory while over-estimators may draw upon excess familiarity when over-estimating their performance. Episodic memory thus appears to play a contributory role in metacognitive judgements of illusory superiority.},

  abstract = {The term dark triad refers to the constellation of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Over the past few years, the concept has gained momentum, with many researchers assuming that the dark triad is a prominent antecedent of transgressive and norm-violating behavior. Our purpose in this meta-analytic review was to evaluate (a) interrelations among narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy; (b) gender differences in these traits; (c) how these traits are linked to normal personality factors; and (d) the psychosocial correlates of the dark triad. Our findings show that dark triad traits are substantially intercorrelated, somewhat more prevalent among men than women, predominantly related to the Big Five personality factor of agreeableness and the HEXACO factor of honesty-humility, and generally associated with various types of negative psychosocial outcomes. We question whether dark triad traits are sufficiently distinct and argue that the way they are currently measured is too simple to capture the malevolent sides of personality. Because most research in this domain is cross-sectional and based on self-reports, we recommend using a cross-informant approach and prospective, longitudinal research designs for studying the predictive value of dark triad features.

Nonetheless, people exhibit a wide range of different motivations when choosing unilaterally among interdependent outcomes. Measuring the magnitude of the concern people have for others, sometimes called Social Value Orientation (SVO), has been an interest of many social scientists for decades and several different measurement methods have been developed so far. Here we introduce a new measure of SVO that has several advantages over existent methods. A detailed description of the new measurement method is presented, along with norming data that provide evidence of its solid psychometric properties. We conclude with a brief discussion of the research streams that would benefit from a more sensitive and higher resolution measure of SVO, and extend an invitation to others to use this new measure which is freely available.},

The findings of the research highly the complex relationships between personal information collection and usage (PICU) factors, personal information control (PIC) factors, and awareness of the effectiveness of privacy policy (AEPP) factors. This culminates in the formulation of a research model based on the theory of reasoned action. Given that the research took place within a context where gender is significant in shaping the worldview of the individual, groups, and society, the paper also seeks to contribute to the existing gender-based narrative on information sharing and privacy issues on SNS, mainly demystifying gender-based stereotypes. \textcopyright{} 2021 IGI Global.

Prior experimental work has shown that circumstances fostering an intermediate rate of forming and breaking social ties (``network fluidity'') facilitate the maintenance of optimal levels of cooperation in experimental social networks. Previous observational work has also suggested a relationship between economic outcomes and network structure (measured statically) at a geographic level. However, it is not known how network fluidity might affect economic growth and inequality, particularly in an experimental setting. Using data from a series of online experiments involving a public goods game in 90 independent, dynamic social networks (with N=1,529 subjects), we show that increasing network fluidity simultaneously achieves the highest level of economic growth and the lowest level of economic inequality, up to a point. These effects of network fluidity on economic outcomes are mediated, in these experiments, by the levels of cooperation and tie formation that subjects evince. Finally, we show that wealthier networks are less unequal. Social network fluidity may play an important role in economic outcomes and hence in social welfare.},

  abstract = {The formation of collaborating pairs by individuals belonging to two different classes occurs in the contexts of reproduction and intea-specific cooperation as well as of inter-specific mutualism. There is potential for partner choice and for competition for access to preferred partners in all three contexts. These selective forces have long been recognised as important in sexual selection, but their impact is not yet appreciated in cooperative and mutualistic systems. The formation of partnerships between members of different classes has much in common with the conclusion of trade agreements in human markets with two classes of traders, like producers and consumers, or employers and employees. Similar game-theoretical models can be used to predict the behaviour of rational traders in human markets and the evolutionarily stable strategies used in biological markets. We present a formal model in which the influence of the market mechanism on selection is made explicit. We restrict ourselves to biological markets in which: (1) Individuals do not compete over access to partners in an agonistic manner, but rather by outcompeting each other in those aspects that are preferred by the choosing party. (2) The commodity the partner has to offer cannot be obtained by the use of force, but requires the consent of the partner. These two restrictions ensure a dominant role for partner choice in the formation of partnerships. In a biological market model the decision to cooperate is based on the comparison between the offers of several potential partners, rather than on the behaviour of a single potential partner, as is implicitly assumed in currently accepted models of cooperation. In our example the members of one class A offer a commodity of fixed value in exchange for a commodity of variable value supplied by the other class, B. We show that when the B-class outnumbers the A-class sufficiently and the cost for the A-class to sample the offers of the B-class are low, the choosiness of the A-class will lead to selection for the supply of high value commodities by the B-class (Fig. 3a). Under the same market conditions, but with a high sampling cost this may still be the evolutionariy stable outcome, but another pair of strategies proves to be stable too: relaxed choosiness of class A coupled with low value commodities supplied by class B (Fig. 3b). We give a number of examples of mating, cooperative and mutualistic markets that resemble the low sampling cost situation depicted in Fig. 3a.},

  abstract = {The evolution of cooperation in network-structured populations has been a major focus of theoretical work in recent years. When players are embedded in fixed networks, cooperators are more likely to interact with, and benefit from, other cooperators. In theory, this clustering can foster cooperation on fixed networks under certain circumstances. Laboratory experiments with humans, however, have thus far found no evidence that fixed network structure actually promotes cooperation. Here, we provide such evidence and help to explain why others failed to find it. First, we show that static networks can lead to a stable high level of cooperation, outperforming well-mixed populations. We then systematically vary the benefit that cooperating provides to one's neighbors relative to the cost required to cooperate (b/c), as well as the average number of neighbors in the network (k). When b/c {$>$} k, we observe high and stable levels of cooperation. Conversely, when b/c {$\leq$} k or players are randomly shuffled, cooperation decays. Our results are consistent with a quantitative evolutionary game theoretic prediction for when cooperation should succeed on networks and, for the first time to our knowledge, provide an experimental demonstration of the power of static network structure for stabilizing human cooperation.},

  abstract = {EVOLUTION IS OFTEN PRESENTED AS A STRICTLY COMPETITIVE ENDEAVOR. This point of view has had serious implications for the way we see the mechanics of both science and culture. But scientists have long wondered how societies could have evolved without some measure of cooperation. And if there was cooperation involved, how could it have arisen from nature ``red in tooth and claw''? Martin Nowak, one of the world's experts on evolution and game theory, working here with bestselling science writer Roger Highfield, turns an important aspect of evolutionary theory on its head to explain why cooperation, not competition, has always been the key to the evolution of complexity. He offers a new explanation for the origin of life and a new theory for the origins of language, biology's second greatest information revolution after the emergence of genes. SuperCooperators also brings to light his game-changing work on disease. Cancer is fundamentally a failure of the body's cells to cooperate, Nowak has discovered, but organs are cleverly designed to foster cooperation, and he explains how this new understanding can be used in novel cancer treatments. Nowak and Highfield examine the phenomena of reciprocity, reputation, and reward, explaining how selfless behavior arises naturally from competition; how forgiveness, generosity, and kindness have a mathematical rationale; how companies can be better designed to promote cooperation; and how there is remarkable overlap between the recipe for cooperation that arises from quantitative analysis and the codes of conduct seen in major religions, such as the Golden Rule. In his first book written for a wide audience, this hugely influential scientist explains his cutting-edge research into the mysteries of cooperation, from the rise of multicellular life to Good Samaritans. With wit and clarity, Nowak and Highfield make the case that cooperation, not competition, is the defining human trait. SuperCooperators will expand our understanding of evolution and provoke debate for years to come.},

  pages = {8},
  abstract = {The two common design principles for agent-based models, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and KIDS (Keep It Descriptive, Stupid) offer limited traction for developing cognitive agents, who typically have strong ties to research findings and established theories of cognition. A KIKS principle (Keep It Knowledgeable, Stupid) is proposed to capture the fact that cognitive agents are grounded in published research findings and theory, rather than simply selecting parameters in an adhoc way. In short, KIKS suggests that modelers should not focus on how many parameters, but should instead focus on choosing the right research papers and implement each of their key parameters and mechanisms. Based on this principle, a design process for creating cognitive agents based on cognitive models is proposed. This process is centered around steps that cognitive agent designers are already consider (e.g., literature search, validation, implementing a computational model). However, the KIKS process suggests two differences. First, KIKS calls for reporting explicit metadata on the empirical and theoretical relationships that an agent's cognitive model is intended to capture. Each such relationship should be associated with a published paper that supports it. This metadata would serve a valuable purpose for comprehending, validating, and comparing the cognitive models used by different agents. Second, KIKS calls for validation tests to be specified before creating an agent's cognitive model computationally. This process, known as test-driven design, can be used to monitor the adherence of a cognitive agent to its underlying knowledge base as it evolves through different versions. Implications, advantages, and limitations of the proposed process for KIKS are discussed.},

Such posts bring social benefits to the users who post them but also to their friends, who view them. Yet, they represent a severe threat to the users' (location) privacy, as co-location information introduces interdependence between users. In this paper, we propose a game theoretical framework for analyzing and predicting the strategic behaviours of users of social networks regarding (co)-location information sharing. In addition, in order to design parametric utility functions as representative as possible of the users' actual preferences, we conduct a survey targeted at Facebook users and rely on conjoint analysis for quantifying the users benefits of sharing vs. viewing (co)-location information and their preference for privacy vs. benefits.We evaluate our framework through data-driven numerical simulations. We show how users' individual preferences influence each others' decisions and identify several factors that significantly impact these decisions, specifically the considered adversary and the preference for privacy vs. benefits.},

Organizations assemble a huge amount of personally identifiable information (PII) for data-driven market analysis and prediction. However, the limitation of data tracking tools restricts the detection of exact data breaching points. Blockchain technology, an `immutable' distributed ledger, can be leveraged to establish a transparent data auditing platform. However, Art. 42 and Art. 25 of general data protection regulation (GDPR) demands `right to forget' and `right to erase' of personal information, which goes against the immutability of blockchain technology. This paper proposes a GDPR complied decentralized and trusted PII sharing and tracking scheme. Proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system (BcPIIMS) demonstrates data movement among GDPR entities (user, controller and processor). Considering GDPR limitations, BcPIIMS used off-the-chain data storing architecture. A prototype was created to validate the proposed architecture using multichain. The use of off-the-chain storage reduces individual block size. Additionally, private blockchain also limits personal data leaking by collecting fast approval from restricted peers. This study presents personal data sharing, deleting, modifying and tracking features to verify the privacy of proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system.},

This paper explores the factors that affect individual concerns regarding IoT use and how those factors affect the dynamics of privacy management with the presence of an IoT device. Design/methodology/approach Four focus groups of individuals and IoT experts were studied to understand the groups' privacy concerns. The authors adopted a qualitative research method based on grounded theory to find relevant dimensions of situational privacy concerns in IoT use situations. Findings The results revealed that fourteen dimensions of individuals' privacy concerns regarding the IoT are relevant and can be categorized under four key influential factors: collection, IoT device, collected data storage and use of collected data. The authors also analyzed the focus groups using genres of disclosure theory and explored how privacy concerns affect individual privacy management regulations. Research limitations/implications This paper contributes to how future research can employ genres of disclosure as a theoretical framework to identify situations where privacy violations occur. Practical implications This study can assist service providers and IoT manufacturers in deriving design principles and decreasing concerns by addressing the information that must be communicated to their users. Originality/value As opposed to the previous research, which was more inclined to dispositional privacy concerns, this study provides insights into situational privacy concerns when individuals are confronted with the IoT. This study represents the first attempt to investigate the process individuals experience in managing their privacy.},

Detailed scrutiny of current research on PET-tools, however, can guide future research to help overcome low adoption of these tools. We conducted a literature review on PET-tools to enumerate the types of tools available and how they are being evaluated, in order to shed more light on the missing elements in their evaluations. We reviewed and coded 72 articles in the PET-tool literature. Our results highlight two important issues: 1.

In the present study, we explored the relationship between the ERP components associated with feedback, namely feedback-related negativity (FRN) and feedback -elated P3b, and investment in an adapted version of the Predator-Prey Game (PPG), operationalizing attack and defence. Forty-seven (28 female) community-dwelling volunteers without history of neurological disease were recruited. Participants played the PPG game both as attackers and defenders while EEG signal was recorded with a 128 channels sensor net. Behavioural results showed that individuals tend to invest more and decide faster when playing in defence, rather than in attack. Electrophysiological data showed FRN to be sensitive to the valence of feedback, with increased amplitudes of FRN loss feedbacks. On the other hand, the P3b amplitudes were sensitive to the role, with increased amplitude for attack when compared with defence. The integration of the behavioural and ERP findings supports the theoretical model positing that attack elicits more deliberate and less automatic brain processes than defence.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, mobile users have a vast number of applications and services at their disposal. Each of these might impose some privacy threats on users' ``Personally Identifiable Information'' (PII). Location privacy is a crucial part of PII, and as such, privacy-aware users wish to maximize it. This privacy can be, for instance, threatened by a company, which collects users' traces and shares them with third parties. To maximize their location privacy, users can decide to get offline so that the company cannot localize their devices. The longer a user stays connected to a network, the more services he might receive, but his location privacy decreases. In this paper, we analyze the trade-off between location privacy, the level of services that a user experiences, and the profit of the company. To this end, we formulate a Stackelberg Bayesian game between the User (follower) and the Company (leader). We present theoretical results characterizing the equilibria of the game. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to model the economically rational decision-making of the service provider (i.e., the Company) in conjunction with the rational decisionmaking of users who wish to protect their location privacy. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we have used real-data from a testbed, and we have also shown that the game-theoretic strategy of the Company outperforms non-strategic methods. Finally, we have considered different User privacy types, and have determined the service level that incentivizes the User to stay connected as long as possible.},

  abstract = {Gossip, one of the core human activities, enforces cooperation, and influences reputation. It is safe to assume that it is a more complex phenomenon than just having a cooperation-building function. Gossip can be linked to a wide variety of mechanisms that are relevant in small groups such as workplaces. The social structure behind gossip is a complex one where individual  motivations; relationships between the sender, the receiver, and the target of the gossip; and  organizational norms and contexts also play a role in its formation. The current dissertation  conducts a thorough, mixed-method analysis of gossip on multiple analytical levels using novel, unique data sources. The questions of the analysis were the following: What are the motivations of the sender for gossiping? Is there a personal or financially driven envy as an explanation for negative gossip?  Is perceived fairness and cooperation influencing gossip dynamics within an organization?  Does gossip only circulate between the sender and receiver when they have a trusting relationship? What set of relationships between the sender, receiver, and target facilitate the sharing of gossip? How do these different sets of relationships lead to different social functions  of gossip? How do gossip texts look structurally? How are the gossip triad members represented in a gossip speech, and what does that tell us about the gossip's intended purpose?

  abstract = {Gossip, one of the core human activities, enforces cooperation, and influences reputation. It is safe to assume that it is a more complex phenomenon than just having a cooperation-building function. Gossip can be linked to a wide variety of mechanisms that are relevant in small groups such as workplaces. The social structure behind gossip is a complex one where individual  motivations; relationships between the sender, the receiver, and the target of the gossip; and  organizational norms and contexts also play a role in its formation. The current dissertation  conducts a thorough, mixed-method analysis of gossip on multiple analytical levels using novel, unique data sources. The questions of the analysis were the following: What are the motivations of the sender for gossiping? Is there a personal or financially driven envy as an explanation for negative gossip?  Is perceived fairness and cooperation influencing gossip dynamics within an organization?  Does gossip only circulate between the sender and receiver when they have a trusting relationship? What set of relationships between the sender, receiver, and target facilitate the sharing of gossip? How do these different sets of relationships lead to different social functions  of gossip? How do gossip texts look structurally? How are the gossip triad members represented in a gossip speech, and what does that tell us about the gossip's intended purpose? What are the organizational determinants of gossip? How does perceived fairness and cohesiveness  contribute to gossip in an organization?  In the dissertation, we relied on two main datasets. The primary one was an online survey conducted with employees from multiple organizations, from 9 workgroups operating in different sectors, recording employee opinions and networks.

Notably, its absence impairs the performance of tasks requiring the maintenance of information through a delay period. In this paper, we formulate a rodent task\textemdash which requires maintenance of delay-period activity\textemdash as a Markov decision process and treat optimal task performance as an (active) inference problem. We simulate the behavior of a Bayes optimal mouse presented with 1 of 2 cues that instructs the selection of concurrent visual and auditory targets on a trial-by-trial basis. Formulating inference as message passing, we reproduce features of neuronal coupling within and between prefrontal regions engaged by this task. We focus on the micro-circuitry that underwrites delay-period activity and relate it to functional specialization within the prefrontal cortex in primates. Finally, we simulate the electrophysiological correlates of inference and demonstrate the consequences of lesions to each part of our in silico prefrontal cortex. In brief, this formulation suggests that recurrent excitatory connections\textemdash which support persistent neuronal activity\textemdash encode beliefs about transition probabilities over time. We argue that attentional modulation can be understood as the contextualization of sensory input by these persistent beliefs.},

Despite noisy sensory data, and volatile environments, creatures appear to actively maintain their integrity. To account for this remarkable ability to make optimal decisions in the face of a capricious world, we propose a generative model that represents the beliefs an agent might possess about their own uncertainty. By simulating a noisy and volatile environment, we demonstrate how uncertainty influences optimal epistemic (visual) foraging. In our simulations, saccades were deployed less frequently to regions with a lower sensory precision, while a greater volatility led to a shorter inhibition of return. These simulations illustrate a principled explanation for some cardinal aspects of visual foraging\textemdash and allow us to propose a correspondence between the representation of uncertainty and ascending neuromodulatory systems, complementing that suggested by Yu \& Dayan (Yu \& Dayan 2005 Neuron46, 681\textendash 692.

Perhaps because of the interdisciplinary appeal of these concepts, the same terms are often used to mean very different things. Drawing on recent advances in theoretical neurobiology, this paper tries to highlight the correspondence between these established psychological constructs and the formal processes implicit in mathematical descriptions of brain function. Here, we consider attention and salience from the perspective offered by active inference. Using variational principles and simulations, we use active inference to demonstrate how attention and salience can be disambiguated in terms of message passing between populations of neurons in cortical and subcortical structures. In brief, we suggest that salience is something that is afforded to actions that realise epistemic affordance, while attention per se is afforded to precise sensory evidence - or beliefs about the causes of sensations. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s).},

We evaluated the recent contention that, in normal samples, this `Dark Triad' of constructs are one and the same. In a sample of 245 students, we measured the three constructs with standard measures and examined a variety of laboratory and self-report correlates. The measures were moderately inter-correlated, but certainly were not equivalent. Their only common Big Five correlate was disagreeableness. Subclinical psychopaths were distinguished by low neuroticism; Machiavellians, and psychopaths were low in conscientiousness; narcissism showed small positive associations with cognitive ability. Narcissists and, to a lesser extent, psychopaths exhibited self-enhancement on two objectively scored indexes. We conclude that the Dark Triad of personalities, as currently measured, are overlapping but distinct constructs.},

To address the preceding gap in knowledge, this paper will describe a study in which conceptual knowledge acquisition (CKA) techniques were applied to a corpus of 32 clinical trials protocol documents in order to develop a knowledge collection of common participant-related clinical research events. These techniques identified 7 high-level concepts that could be used as organizing principles in the resulting knowledge collection. Such results confirm the utility of CKA methods in the clinical research domain.},

The evolutionary success of our species is indeed due, to a large degree, to our unparalleled other-regarding abilities. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of human cooperation remains a formidable challenge. Recent research in the social sciences indicates that it is important to focus on the collective behavior that emerges as the result of the interactions among individuals, groups, and even societies. Non-equilibrium statistical physics, in particular Monte Carlo methods and the theory of collective behavior of interacting particles near phase transition points, has proven to be very valuable for understanding counterintuitive evolutionary outcomes. By treating models of human cooperation as classical spin models, a physicist can draw on familiar settings from statistical physics. However, unlike pairwise interactions among particles that typically govern solid-state physics systems, interactions among humans often involve group interactions, and they also involve a larger number of possible states even for the most simplified description of reality. The complexity of solutions therefore often surpasses that observed in physical systems. Here we review experimental and theoretical research that advances our understanding of human cooperation, focusing on spatial pattern formation, on the spatiotemporal dynamics of observed solutions, and on self-organization that may either promote or hinder socially favorable states.},

Results demonstrate that citizens do not fully understand the terminology used in newspaper articles concerning DP and DS. Moreover, findings show that DP and DS are of great importance to citizens. However, the perceived relevance of DP and DS varies between services, being strongest for online banking. Compared to the German citizens surveyed, the UK citizens displayed greater concerns about disclosing personal data online. Despite some differences, however, findings across both samples indicate a common lack of understanding of the two concepts DP and DS. The resulting citizen concept of DP and DS can help to mediate between politics, technology and the public in the discourse of e-government initiatives and the requirements for DP and DS. We argue that citizens' understanding of DP and DS is a prerequisite for governments to adequately address citizens' concerns regarding e-government initiatives.},

One of the most promising forms of paradata is the movement, or trajectory, of the cursor in making a response. This study presented correlations between such indices and constructed components representing their common variance. Moreover, it provided an interpretation and validation of these components (interpreted as indicators of complexity, hesitancy, and regularity), among others, by correlating them with previously known indices of careless responding.

  abstract = {Objective Effective use of telehealth offers substantial benefits to older persons and aged care providers. However, data privacy concerns challenge the effective use of telehealth and subsequent business value. Through developing a theoretical model, we explain how privacy concerns can influence the adoption ad use of telehealth in this complex context. Method An integrative review of empirical investigations was conducted by linking privacy concerns, telehealth use, and aged care. We searched three major databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) for articles published until December 2020. Articles were analyzed and presented using an integrative theoretical model that we labeled CPCPO (Context-Privacy Concerns-Practice-Outcomes). Results Our review revealed that privacy concerns are a contextual concept, i.e., different contexts (users, telehealth systems, aged care services, data) produce different privacy concerns. We found that privacy concerns were more voiced in home telecare and were associated with the degree of telemonitoring and surveillance. Contextual privacy concerns were related to video recording, behavioral data (e.g., sleep patterns and eating behavior), location data, and future use of data. These concerns can influence the adoption and use of telehealth. However, privacy protection practices (e.g., informed consent) can help in reducing the concerns and improving the acceptance of telehealth for older persons. Conclusion CPCPO offers contextual explanations of telehealth privacy concerns and systems use. For improving telehealth acceptance, privacy concerns of data processing (e.g., recording, collection, storage, and secondary use) must be addressed by performing data protection practices. Based on the review results, we suggest avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Consumer researchers frequently employ valuation experiments to assess consumer opinions and test related hypotheses. One popular method used in many such experiments is the Becker- DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) single-response value elicitation procedure that initiates an incentive for the subjects to respond with their true valuation by utilizing a random bid to which the participants' bid is compared. However, the ``random bid'' is not a straightforward concept, and the participants may not fully understand the mechanics of the bidding process. Therefore, they may incorrectly associate the bidding mechanism with a conventional auction bidding process in which the highest bidder wins, causing biased valuation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a comprehension measurement step to eliminate the process comprehension bias in BDM valuation experiments. We also discuss the potential impact of the treatment of ``zero'' bidders in the BDM procedure. The present work shows that the size and statistical significance of past consumer research results are positively correlated with the participant comprehension of the valuation procedure. The results suggest that consumer research using a single-response value elicitation procedure, which initiates an incentive for the subjects to respond with their true valuation, may not be trusted if the comprehension level is not controlled.},

Privacy concerns make consumers adopt data protection features, guide their appreciation for existing features, and can steer their consumption choices amongst competing businesses. However, approaches to measure privacy concern are fragmented and often ad-hoc, at the detriment of reliable results. The need for measurement instruments for privacy concern is twofold. First, attitudes and opinions about data protection cannot be established and compared without reliable mechanisms. Second, behavioural studies, notably in technology acceptance and the behavioural economics of privacy require measures for concern as a moderating factor. In its first part, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing survey instruments for measuring privacy concerns. The second part focuses on revealed preferences that can be used for opportunistically measuring privacy concerns in the wild or for scale validation. Recommendations for scale selection and reuse are provided. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, it takes a closer look at the epistemological foundations of Big Data as one prominent representation of digital technologies. While Big Data and Big Data-based results and decisions are generally believed to be objective and neutral, numeral cases of algorithmic discrimination have lately begged to differ. This paper argues that algorithmic discrimination is neither random nor accidental; on the contrary, it is - amongst others - the result of the epistemological foundation of Big Data - namely: data fundamentalism, post-explanatory anticipatory pragmatics, and anti-political solutionism. As a consequence, a critical engagement with the concepts and premises that become materialized in the design of digital technologies is needed, if they are not to silently (re)produce social inequalities.},

While studies have investigated the effects of individual factors such as privacy concern, and trust, on SNS users' self-disclosure intention, less research has examined how characteristics of the SNS platform shape such intention. In this study, we focus on one critical characteristic of SNS platform, SNS transparency, and investigate its impact (direct and indirect via Information Control) on individuals' self-disclosure intention and the moderating role of privacy disposition. Specifically, we identify three SNS transparency features\textemdash Network Transparency, Social Presence, and Monitoring. Drawing from Communication Privacy Management Theory and Social Penetration Theory, we empirically test how these SNS transparency features directly and indirectly via Information Control influence users' self-disclosure intention. The results of our experiment show that network transparency has negative effects while social presence, as well as monitoring, have positive effects on information control. Network transparency, social presence, and information control have positive effects on self-disclosure intention. This study extends the literature by enhancing our understanding of how the SNS platform features and individual privacy disposition shape SNS users' self-disclosure intention.},

In parallel, significant privacy concerns have shaken consumer\textendash firm relationships, prompting changes in both regulatory interventions and people's own privacy-protective behaviors. With a comprehensive analysis of digital technologies and data strategy informed by structuration theory and privacy literature, the authors consider privacy tensions as the product of firm\textendash consumer interactions, facilitated by digital technologies. This perspective in turn implies distinct consumer, regulatory, and firm responses related to data protection. By consolidating various perspectives, the authors propose three tenets and seven propositions, supported by interview insights from senior managers and consumer informants, that create a foundation for understanding the digital technology implications for firm performance in contexts marked by growing privacy worries and legal ramifications. On the basis of this conceptual framework, they also propose a data strategy typology across two main strategic functions of digital technologies: data monetization and data sharing. The result is four distinct types of firms, which engage in disparate behaviors in the broader ecosystem pertaining to privacy issues. This article also provides directions for research, according to a synthesis of findings from both academic and practical perspectives.},

  abstract = {In the traditional spatial public goods game (SPGG), the total contributions of each group are linearly amplified by the same enhancement factor, which does not coincide with the real situation. Although some literature has considered the non-linearity and heterogeneity of scale returns between groups, the differences are completely generated by stochastic mechanisms. In addition, the coefficient will not change once assigned in previous studies. In this paper, we consider an environmental feedback mechanism and introduce a dynamic scale return coefficient into the payoff function. We observe that people who have a good record of cooperation working together can produce greater synergies and can have a larger return coefficient. We use the concept of reputation to describe individuals' historical cooperation records. Therefore, we assume that the scale return coefficient is governed by the difference between the average reputation of the group and the whole population, which will also evolve over time. In addition, we set a reputation amplitude to control the extent to which reputation differences between groups affect payoffs. By simulation experiments, we reveal that dynamic scale return coefficient based on reputation difference between groups helps to promote the evolution of cooperation. Moreover, the magnitude of the reputation amplitude directly affects the level of cooperation and the emergence of cooperative clusters. Our model provides a new way to introduce the environmental feedback mechanism to payoffs function and facilitate the in-depth study of the impact of reputation on cooperation. \textcopyright{} 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.},

We review theories speaking to the interconnections of cognition and affect, identifying the need for further theory development regarding modeling moment-by-moment decision-making processes. We discuss how these theoretical perspectives are mirrored in empirical evidence, drawn from classical outcome-oriented as well as contemporary process-tracing research. Finally, we develop perspectives for future research trajectories aiming to further elucidate the processes by which prosocial decisions are formed, by linking process measures to usually unobservable cognitive and affective reactions.},

Methods A group of health science researchers anchored in various qualitative research traditions gathered in reflective group discussions over a period of two years. Results Efforts to establish an anti-authoritarian relationship between researcher and researched, negotiation of who actually ``rules'' the research agenda, and experiences of shifts in ``inferior'' and ``superior'' knowledge positions emerged as central and intertwined themes throughout the discussions. The dual role as both insider and outsider, characteristic of qualitative approaches, seemed to lead to power relations and researcher vulnerability which manifested in tangible ways. Conclusion Shifting positions and vulnerability surfaced in various ways in the projects. They nonetheless indicated a number of similar experiences which can shed light on the researcher-researched relationship. These issues could benefit from further discussion in the qualitative health research literature.},

We evaluate this approach on three different tasks and show that the agents are able to learn better policies using their estimate of the other players' goals, in both cooperative and competitive settings.},

Throughout its history, Mexico City's Historic Centre has served as a site of informal commerce. However, the adoption of neoliberal economic policies and the privatisation of public spaces have produced a paradox. While the number of street vendors rises as options for gainful employment dwindle, the criminalisation of their means of subsistence has exposed these individuals to police bribes, confiscation and harassment. Sounds (e.g., street cries, whistles and coded language) are essential to the maintenance of this tenuous way of life. Sounds are used to lure customers, claim territory and execute highly coordinated evasions of police raids. This article explores the specialised listening and sound-making of street vendors and demonstrates the integral relationship between aurality and subaltern resistance in contemporary Mexico City.},

On the one hand, proponents of empathy argue that it plays a crucial role in the process of making moral judgments, moral motivation, moral development, and the cultivation of meaningful personal relationships. On the other hand, critics of empathy warn that it is especially susceptible to a number of morally troubling biases and motivational shortcomings. Yet there is little consensus about what empathy is or what it might be good for from a moral point of view. As a result, critics and proponents of empathy alike often wind up talking past each other and debates about empathy's role in morality reach an impasse. This paper proposes a typology of empathy's affective, cognitive, and motivational dimensions and the different forms that empathy can take depending on the nature and degree of prominence of these. It argues that different forms of empathy are well equipped to handle some moral tasks as well as ill-equipped to handle others. Its aim in doing so is to clarify an otherwise conceptually thorny set of debates and to amplify future research on empathy and its role in the moral life.}

This issue of understanding how to make security tools and mechanisms work better for humans (often categorized as usability, broadly construed) has become increasingly important over the past 17 years, as illustrated by the growing body of research. Usable security and privacy research has improved our understanding of how to help users stay safe from phishing attacks, and control access to their accounts, as just three examples.     One key technique for understanding and improving how human decision making affects security is the gathering of self-reported data from users. This data is typically gathered via survey and interview studies, and serves to inform the broader security and privacy community about user needs, behaviors, and beliefs. The quality of this data, and the validity of subsequent research results, depends on the choices researchers make when designing their experiments. Contained here is a set of essential guidelines for conducting self-report usability studies distilled from prior work in survey methodology and related fields. Other fields that rely on self-report data, such as the health and social sciences, have established guidelines and recommendations for collecting high quality self-report data.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Social learning is increasingly becoming a normative goal in natural resource management and policy. However, there remains little consensus over its meaning or theoretical basis. There are still considerable differences in understanding of the concept in the literature, including a number of articles published in Ecology \& Society. Social learning is often conflated with other concepts such as participation and proenvironmental behavior, and there is often little distinction made between individual and wider social learning. Many unsubstantiated claims for social learning exist, and there is frequently confusion between the concept itself and its potential outcomes. This lack of conceptual clarity has limited our capacity to assess whether social learning has occurred, and if so, what kind of learning has taken place, to what extent, between whom, when, and how. This response attempts to provide greater clarity on the conceptual basis for social learning. We argue that to be considered social learning, a process must: (1) demonstrate that a change in understanding has taken place in the individuals involved; (2) demonstrate that this change goes beyond the individual and becomes situated within wider social units or communities of practice; and (3) occur through social interactions and processes between actors within a social network. A clearer picture of what we mean by social learning could enhance our ability to critically evaluate outcomes and better understand the processes through which social learning occurs. In this way, it may be possible to better facilitate the desired outcomes of social learning processes.},

We find that positive, negative, and ambivalent attitudes coexist in the population (Study 1). We also find that individuals are cognizant of privacy-intrusiveness (Study 2), suggesting sharing is not mindless. Rather, individuals share more when concerns are relatively lower, versus when only concerns or both concerns and benefits are emphasized (positive, negative, and balanced attitudinal nudges; Studies 3 and 4). Further, we find that attitudinal and behavioral nudges separately influence sharing (Study 4).

It argues for a containment space, separating the largely uncontrollable external environment from the internal threat-reduced residential space, for a separation of visitor entertainment areas and private sleeping areas, as well as the design of a spatially separated master bedroom that can double as a self-isolation space if the need arises. The implications of this new design on existing housing stock are also discussed. The advocated concepts are novel and advance the design considerations for future residential developments.},

  abstract = {There is often a discrepancy between what consumers expect from firms regarding the way their personal data should be handled and how people actually behave when a firm misuses such data and violate their data protection rights. This was put in evidence in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal: consumers are genuinely concerned about how their data is exploited by firms like Facebook, but their behaviour (i.e. continuing to use the social network) does not seem to correspond to those concerns due to the presence of internal and external factors. The impact of this discrepancy between privacy expectations in abstracto and in concreto on the enforcement of market-relevant legislation such as data protection, consumer and competition laws has not been sufficiently explored. This contribution looks at whether behavioural economics could provide insights about the value that people attribute to their privacy in view of informing competition law enforcement in data-driven markets.},

The results are controversial, and the investigation of the active component has been inhibited by the absence of any appropriate experimental procedures. A new task was developed involving the mental reconstruction of pictures of objects from fragmented pieces, and this provides a useful procedure for exploring active visuospatial processing. Significant differences in terms of both correctness and response latency were obtained between young and older adults and between younger old and older old adults. Performance also varied with visual complexity, mental rotation, and processing load. It is concluded that this ecologically relevant procedure constitutes a very powerful, sensitive, and reliable tool for identifying individual differences in visuospatial working memory.},

  abstract = {Indirect reciprocity potentially provides an important means for generating cooperation based on helping those who help others. However, the use of `image scores' to summarize individuals' past behaviour presents a dilemma: individuals withholding help from those of low image score harm their own reputation, yet giving to defectors erodes cooperation. Explaining how indirect reciprocity could evolve has therefore remained problematic. In all previous treatments of indirect reciprocity, individuals are assigned potential recipients and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on their reputation. A second way of achieving discrimination is through partner choice, which should enable individuals to avoid defectors. Here, I develop a model in which individuals choose to donate to anyone within their group, or to none. Whereas image scoring with random pairing produces cycles of cooperation and defection, with partner choice there is almost maximal cooperation. In contrast to image scoring with random pairing, partner choice results in almost perfect contingency, producing the correlation between giving and receiving required for cooperation. In this way, partner choice facilitates much higher and more stable levels of cooperation through image scoring than previously reported and provides a simple mechanism through which systems of helping those who help others can work.},

  abstract = {Purpose The viability of online anonymity is questioned in today's online environment where many technologies enable tracking and identification of individuals. In light of the shortcomings of the government, industry and consumers in protecting anonymity, it is clear that a new perspective for ensuring anonymity is needed. Where current stakeholders have failed to protect anonymity, some proponents argue that economic models exist for valuation of anonymity. By placing a monetary value on anonymity through Rawls' concept of primary goods, it is possible to create a marketplace for anonymity, therefore allowing users full control of how their personal data is used. This paper aims to explore the creation of a data marketplace, offering users the possibility of engaging with companies and other entities to sell and auction personal data. Importantly, participation in a marketplace does not sacrifice one's anonymity, as there are different levels of anonymity in online systems. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a conceptual framework based on the abstractions of anonymity and data valuation. Findings The manuscript constructs a conceptual foundation for exploring the development and deployment of a personal data marketplace. By suggesting features allowing individuals' control of their personal data, and properly establishing monetary valuation of one's personal data, it is argued that individuals will undertake a more proactive management of personal data. Originality/value An overview of the available services and products offering increased anonymity is explored, in turn, illustrating the beginnings of a market response for anonymity as a valuable good. By placing a monetary value on individuals' anonymity, it is reasoned that individuals will more consciously protect their anonymity in ways where legislation and other practices (i.e. privacy policies, marketing opt-out) have failed.},

The model proposes that members of groups sharing resources first anchor their consumption choices on an "equal-division" heuristic and then, given sufficient cognitive capacity, adjust their choices in a self-serving direction. The results from both studies support the model. The first study found that when faced with a common resource pool almost all group members expressed thoughts regarding equality; however, individuals with sufficient cognitive capacity requested more from the pool and expressed more task-relevant thoughts than individuals lacking the necessary cognitive resources. The second study provided additional support for the two-stage model by demonstrating that group members' cognitions occur in the order predicted by the model and by demonstrating that an individual difference, social value orientation, affects thought processes only when individuals are not experiencing high cognitive loads. Implications are discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

Two levels of social value orientation (cooperative, noncooperative) were crossed with 2 levels of replenishment rate uncertainty (low, high). As predicted, noncooperators harvested significantly more resources than cooperators and high uncertainty Ss harvested more resources than low uncertainty Ss. The primary finding was the hypothesized 3-way interaction among social value orientation, environmental uncertainty, and trials: Social value orientation moderated harvest decisions only under conditions of high uncertainty during the middle series of harvest trials. Noncooperators increased their harvests during this period, while cooperators harvested less and held their harvests constant across these trials. The results demonstrate that systematic individual differences exist in decision makers' responses to high environmental uncertainty. Social value orientation may exert its effect by influencing the scanning and processing of goal-relevant cues in this decision environment.

However, the research is incoherent, with inconsistencies among models. Therefore, the application and subsequent development of PBMs are challenging. Different background theories are used for model construction, and studies have been conducted in distinct application domains. We studied whether the models' inconsistencies could be explained by these differences. Our in-depth analysis of PBMs was based on a systematic literature review of the most often cited key studies. Our findings indicate that the choice of theories and the application domains do not explain inconsistencies; instead, the models are often of an ad hoc type and constructed in an eclectic way.

We point to unique features of values that have implications to their relationships with behavior and build on these features to review past research. We then propose a conceptual model that presents three organizing principles: accessibility, interpretation, and control. For each principle, we identify mechanisms through which values and behavior are connected. Some of these mechanisms have been exemplified in past research and are reviewed; others call for future research. Integrating the knowledge on the multiple ways in which values impact behavior deepens our understanding of the complex ways through which cognition is translated into action.},

A longstanding problem in this regard has been to determine how decisions of individuals can be combined to form intelligent group decisions. Our study consisted of a random target detection task in natural scenes, where human subjects (18 subjects, 7 female) detected the presence or absence of a random target as indicated by the cue word displayed prior to stimulus display. Concurrently the neural activities (EEG signals) were recorded. A separate behavioural experiment was performed by different subjects (20 subjects, 11 female) on the same set of images to categorize the tasks according to their difficulty levels. We demonstrate that the weighted average of individual decision confidence/neural decision variables produces significantly better performance than the frequently used majority pooling algorithm. Further, the classification error rates from individual judgement were found to increase with increasing task difficulty. This error could be significantly reduced upon combining the individual decisions using group aggregation rules. Using statistical tests, we show that combining all available participants is unnecessary to achieve minimum classification error rate. We also try to explore if group aggregation benefits depend on the correlation between the individual judgements of the group and our results seem to suggest that reduced inter-subject correlation can improve collective decision making for a fixed difficulty level.},

  abstract = {2-Player games in general provide a popular platform for research in Artificial Intelligence (AI). One of the main challenges coming from this plat-form is approximating a Nash Equilibrium (NE) over zero-sum matrix games. While the problem of computing such a Nash Equilibrium is solvable in polyno-mial time using Linear Programming (LP), it rapidly becomes infeasible to solve as the size of the matrix grows; a situation commonly encountered in games. This paper focuses on improving the approximation of a NE for matrix games such that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms given a finite (and rather small) number T of oracle requests to rewards. To reach this objective, we pro-pose to share information between the different relevant pure strategies. We show both theoretically by improving the bound and empirically by experiments on ar-tificial matrices and on a real-world game that information sharing leads to an improvement of the approximation of the NE.},

  abstract = {Deception plays a critical role in the dissemination of information, and has important consequences on the functioning of cultural, market-based and democratic institutions. Deception has been widely studied within the fields of philosophy, psychology, economics and political science. Yet, we still lack an understanding of how deception emerges in a society under competitive (evolutionary) pressures. This paper begins to fill this gap by bridging evolutionary models of social good - public goods games (PGGs) - with ideas from interpersonal deception theory (Buller and Burgoon 1996 Commun. Theory 6, 203-242. (doi:10.1111/j.1468-2885.1996.tb00127.x)) and truth-default theory (Levine 2014 J. Lang. Soc. Psychol. 33, 378-392. (doi:10.1177/0261927X14535916); Levine 2019 Duped: truth-default theory and the social science of lying and deception. University of Alabama Press). This provides a well-founded analysis of the growth of deception in societies and the effectiveness of several approaches to reducing deception. Assuming that knowledge is a public good, we use extensive simulation studies to explore (i) how deception impacts the sharing and dissemination of knowledge in societies over time, (ii) how different types of knowledge sharing societies are affected by deception and (iii) what type of policing and regulation is needed to reduce the negative effects of deception in knowledge sharing. Our results indicate that cooperation in knowledge sharing can be re-established in systems by introducing institutions that investigate and regulate both defection and deception using a decentralized case-by-case strategy. This provides evidence for the adoption of methods for reducing the use of deception in the world around us in order to avoid a Tragedy of the Digital Commons (Greco and Floridi 2004 Ethics Inf.

In this context, the present study aims to define and identify (i) the main concepts and (ii) performance measurements that social networks use to increase user engagement and modify user online behavior from the perspective of ethical design and surveillance capitalism in social media. Since previous research on this issue is scarce, this study bridges this gap in the literature by developing a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of major scientific contributions made so far in this research area. We identify a total of 10 performance measurements and 4 ethical design measurements used by social media companies to increase user engagement and to achieve user behavior modification online, at times without users' awareness about this effect. Furthermore, we critically analyze the identified 14 indicators, as previous research suggests that these indicators can generate addiction and modification of user behavior and feelings. The paper concludes with a discussion of important theoretical and practical implications of ethical design in social media for further research; we also question the economic approaches proposed in the business models of digital and social media platforms. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Individual variation in behavioral strategies is ubiquitous in nature. Yet, explaining how this variation is being maintained remains a challenging task. We use a spatially-explicit individual-based simulation model to evaluate the extent to which the efficiency of an alternative spacing tactic of prey and an alternative search tactic of predators are influenced by the spatial pattern of prey, social interactions among predators (i.e., interference and information sharing) and predator density. In response to predation risk, prey individuals can either spread out or aggregate. We demonstrate that if prey is extremely clumped, spreading out may help when predators share information regarding prey locations and when predators shift to area-restricted search following an encounter with prey. However, dispersion is counter-selected when predators interact by interference, especially under high predator density. When predators search for more randomly distributed prey, interference and information sharing similarly affect the relative advantage of spreading out. Under a clumped prey spatial pattern, predators benefit from shifting their search tactic to an area-restricted search following an encounter with prey. This advantage is moderated as predator density increases and when predators interact either by interference or information sharing. Under a more random prey pattern, information sharing may deteriorate the inferior search tactic even more, compared to interference or no interaction among predators. Our simulation clarifies how interactions among searching predators may affect aggregation behavior of prey, the relative success of alternative search tactics and their potential to invade established populations using some other search or spacing tactics.},

  abstract = {Information sharing is an integral part of human interaction that serves to build social relationships and affects attitudes and behaviors in individuals and large groups. We present a unifying neurocognitive framework of mechanisms underlying information sharing at scale (virality). We argue that expectations regarding self-related and social consequences of sharing (e.g., in the form of potential for self-enhancement or social approval) are integrated into a domain-general value signal that encodes the value of sharing a piece of information. This value signal translates into population-level virality. In two studies (n = 41 and 39 participants), we tested these hypotheses using functional neuroimaging. Neural activity in response to 80 New York Times articles was observed in theory-driven regions of interest associated with value, self, and social cognitions. This activity then was linked to objectively logged population-level data encompassing n = 117,611 internet shares of the articles. In both studies, activity in neural regions associated with self-related and social cognition was indirectly related to population- level sharing through increased neural activation in the brain's value system. Neural activity further predicted populationlevel outcomes over and above the variance explained by article characteristics and commonly used self-report measures of sharing intentions. This parsimonious framework may help advance theory, improve predictive models, and inform new approaches to effective intervention. More broadly, these data shed light on the core functions of sharing-to express ourselves in positive ways and to strengthen our social bonds.},

Recent advances in neuroscience reveal information about the psychological mechanisms that drive sharing, with a particular focus on self-relevance, social cognition, and subjective value. Based on these insights, this chapter proposes a structural model of the neurocognitive and psychological processes that drive sharing decisions, called value-based virality. Further, it maps existing knowledge about neural correlates and moderators of thought processes linked to individual and population-level sharing events and outcomes and suggests avenues for future investigation. Finally, the chapter discusses the potential of the neuroscience of information sharing to interact productively with other methodological traditions such as computational social science. Initial neuroimaging studies of information sharing provide insights into psychological mechanisms that were previously inaccessible. With the development of more realistic experimental setups and multimethod designs, future efforts promise advances toward a unifying theory of why and how people share information.},

This article provides four experimental studies with a total of 470 participants that help characterize individual preferences for sharing personal data varying the characteristics of potential recipients. We find that participants' willingness to share personal data with anonymous recipients decreases with the number of recipients. However, social distance to the recipients and the amount of personal data a single recipient receives do not decrease the willingness to share personal data. Further, we provide a methodological insight by showing that verification of personal data is essential when eliciting privacy pReferences},

  abstract = {The surveillance of social media-based data is extensive, showing little signs of abating. Alarmingly, social media corporates are seemingly irreproachable in this matter with many data surveillance practices persisting\textemdash even post Cambridge Analytica. In this article, we argue, and demonstrate, that although data surveillance is not a new concept, it has evolved from a mechanism which benefited society to an instrument of control; not only to control the accumulation of capital but more importantly user behavior. To illustrate this, we use Facebook Apps as an example to demonstrate both the scope and the implications of such surveillance practices. This article contributes by arguing how the evolution of data surveillance has culminated in the slow erosion of information privacy by aggregating data across several Facebook Apps. We conclude that data surveillance via social media is taking place, which holds inherent risk in the consumption (and production) of social media-based information. This does not necessarily refer simply to the short-term risks (e.g., fraud, phishing, and identity theft), but also to those that are long term in nature, such as the loss of control once engaged with social media. Once the data has been harvested, aggregated and shared, it is almost impossible to reverse and thus persists as part of a data assemblage that is forever associated with an individual. As such, we argue that this precludes individuals from reinventing themselves (e.g., moving to a new city to start ``a new life''), as their aggregated profile will follow them. The resulting problem carries with it profound psychological and societal implications. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {p{$>$}The study explores the relation of narcissism to political orientation and their association with basic human values, using an undergraduate sample from Turkey. Leftwing orientation is weakly and negatively correlated with narcissism, and specifically with its self-sufficiency dimension. Leftwing is correlated positively with universalism and negatively with tradition. Narcissism is positively correlated with the self-enhancement and openness to change dimensions and negatively correlated with the self-transcendence and conservatism dimensions of the basic values. Hierarchical regression results indicate that the value tradition is a stronger predictor of political orientation than narcissism. In multinomial logistic regression, for narcissism, statistical significance appears for only extreme right compared to moderate left political positions. We did not find power-hunger to be related to political orientation. We did not find pro-sociality to be related to familial-religious customs. We did not find any sex difference for mean narcissism scores. However, females are more leftwing oriented than males and they report more eagerness to strive for justice for others. Striving for justice for others is negatively correlated with the value power; positively correlated with leftwing orientation and striving for justice for self; and uncorrelated with narcissism. Males have higher mean scores for the value tradition and females have higher mean scores for the value security.},

In public goods experiments, initial cooperation usually drops quickly to almost zero5. It can be maintained by the opportunity to punish defectors6 or the need to maintain good reputation7. Both schemes require that defectors are identified. Theorists propose that a simple but effective mechanism operates under full anonymity.

Here we propose a multilayer network model that takes into account that not only individuals are connected by means of networks, but that also groups can be connected in much the same way. The model thus couples together network reciprocity and group selection, and it allows us to study their joint effect on the evolution of cooperation. We use the prisoner's dilemma game as the paradigmatic social dilemma example, showing that the fine-tuning of evolution frequency and the imitation rate in the group network play key roles in determining the survival thresholds of cooperators. We also explore the importance of deterministic and stochastic updating rules, showing that the former provides more options to further promote cooperation. We discuss the importance of our findings for cooperation in structured interactions among groups and in higher-order networks.},

This article considers a generalized form of the stable marriage problem, where different numbers of men and women need to be matched pairwise and the emergence of single men or women is inevitable. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that even a small deviation on the number of men and women from the equality condition can have a large impact on the matching solution of the Gale-Shapley algorithm. These results provide insights to many of the real-world applications when matching two sides with an unequal number.},

In particular, how do rare experiences with members who stand out (e.g., negative experiences when most are positive) influence the overall impression we have of the group? Here, we show that such rare events may be overweighted due to normative inference of the hidden, or latent, causes that are believed to generate the observed events. We propose a Bayesian latent-cause inference model that learns environmental statistics by combining highly similar events together and separating rare or highly variable observations. The model predicts that group evaluations that rely on averaging inferred latent causes will overweight variable events. We empirically tested these model-derived predictions in four decision-making experiments, where subjects observed a sequence of social (Exp 1 to 3) or non-social (Exp 4) behaviors and were subsequently asked to estimate the average of observed values. As predicted by our latent-cause model, average estimation was biased toward rare and highly variable events when observing social behaviors. We then showed that tracking of a single summary value, instead of parsing events into distinct latent causes, eliminates the bias. These results suggest that biases in evaluations of social groups, such as negativity bias, may arise from the causal inference process of the group.}

The extent to which positive affect experience prospectively drives behavior change (as distinct from rewarding the desired behavior) is less clear.

We show that cooperation can not only be stabilized, but even promoted, when the bots intervene in the partner selections made by the humans, re-shaping social connections locally within a larger group. Cooperation rates increased from 60.4\% at baseline to 79.4\% at the end. This network-intervention strategy outperformed other strategies, such as adding bots playing tit-for-tat. We also confirm that even a single bot can foster cooperation in human groups by using a mixed strategy designed to support the development of cooperative clusters. Simple artificial intelligence can increase the cooperation of groups.},

Here we use a series of online experiments involving 1,529 unique participants embedded in 90 experimental networks, to show that there is a 'Goldilocks' effect of network dynamism on cooperation. When the rate of change in social ties is too low, subjects choose to have many ties, even if they attach to defectors. When the rate is too high, cooperators cannot detach from defectors as much as defectors re-attach and, hence, subjects resort to behavioural reciprocity and switch their behaviour to defection. Optimal levels of cooperation are achieved at intermediate levels of change in social ties.},

  abstract = {Technologically enabled sharing-economy networks are changing the way humans trade and collaborate. Here, using a novel `Wi-Fi sharing' game, we explored determinants of human sharing strategy. Subjects (N\,=\,1,950) participated in a networked game in which they could choose how to allocate a limited, but personally not usable, resource (representing unused Wi-Fi bandwidth) to immediate network neighbors. We first embedded N\,=\,600 subjects into 30 networks, experimentally manipulating the range over which subjects could connect. We find that denser networks decrease any wealth inequality, but that this effect saturates. Individuals' benefit is shaped by their network position, with having many partners who in turn have few partners being especially beneficial. We propose a new, simplified ``sharing centrality'' metric for quantifying this. Further experiments (N\,=\,1,200) confirm the robustness of the effect of network structure on sharing behavior. Our findings suggest the possibility of interventions to help more evenly distribute shared resources over networks.},

However, both the emergence and the stability of costly punishment are problematic issues. It is not clear how punishers can invade a society of defectors by social learning or natural selection, or how second-order free-riders (who contribute to the joint effort but not to the sanctions) can be prevented from drifting into a coercion-based regime and subverting cooperation. Here we compare the prevailing model of peer-punishment with pool-punishment, which consists in committing resources, before the collaborative effort, to prepare sanctions against free-riders. Pool-punishment facilitates the sanctioning of second-order free-riders, because these are exposed even if everyone contributes to the common good. In the absence of such second-order punishment, peer-punishers do better than pool-punishers; but with second-order punishment, the situation is reversed. Efficiency is traded for stability. Neither other-regarding tendencies or preferences for reciprocity and equity, nor group selection or prescriptions from higher authorities, are necessary for the emergence and stability of rudimentary forms of sanctioning institutions regulating common pool resources and enforcing collaborative efforts. \textcopyright{} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, it is also possible that attempting to constrain the process by which problem solvers manage this reflection process may prevent them from effectively tailoring their approach to different problems. The current research focuses on how the nature of different knowledge transfer strategies impacts problem solving processes and outcomes by examining manipulations of, or constraints to, problem solvers' approach to knowledge transfer. Participants were directed to generate associated knowledge in preparation for answering a series of estimation items, either in a group or individually. We found that groups using a shared reflection process (as opposed to reflecting at an individual member level) were able to give more weight to the inputs of their more expert members and that groups outperformed individuals. We discuss the process of promoting knowledge transfer in a group context relative to an individual context and relate this to the concept of task demonstrability.

Moreover, organisations are dealing with increasing amounts of Personally Identifiable Information in their systems. Thus, there is a high demand not only for privacy-preserving data processing mechanisms but also privacy-enhancing services. As such, we propose the Personal Data Analyser, a tool that increases privacy assurances and minimises privacy risks through automated privacy-preserving data monitoring and privacy risk assessment mechanisms. Automated data monitoring is achieved with a hybrid mechanism that employs Regular Expressions, Natural Language Processing tools, and machine learning models such as Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forests. Our privacy risk assessment mechanism is based on custom-built crisp and fuzzy models, that consider information such as data processor reputation, data sensitiveness and other inputs in order to assess privacy risk associated with data transactions. Our work is integrated and validated under real use cases of the PoSeID-on platform and warns users whenever potential privacy risks are detected. Validation under PoSeID-on's pilots and its users proved beneficial not only to assess our solution but also to raise users' awareness of their data. The results of this work show that our solution is an effective Privacy Enhancing Technology that increases privacy assurances between organisations and their users.},

  abstract = {Power is becoming a critical constraint for designing embedded applications because the amount of power available to these portable systems is limited due to battery life. On the other hand, many of the emerging real-time applications designed for battery-operated systems, such as wireless communication, and audio and video processing, tend to compete in order to gain a larger fraction of the energy provided by the common (public) source. It is known that both cooperation and competition are very important for every vivid system operation and evolution because cooperation leads to the formation of more complex systems and competition is crucial for the efficient operation, especially when common sources are used. In this paper, we study the cooperation between individuals, i.e., power-aware jobs, of a group, i.e., an embedded system, in a power-aware changing environment, using a variation of the public goods game, in which the changing environment is modeled by a variable multiplication factor. Based on this PGG, we aim to find out what are the most essential conditions under which the cooperation between the power-aware jobs in periodically and abruptly power-aware changing environments of the embedded system is emerging and sustained. The most interesting result is that even in harsh situations, the jobs maintain a degree of cooperation to exploit favorable future energy changes in the power-aware environment. \textcopyright{} 2012 IEEE.},

The underlying rationale is to decrease the amount of missing data. Despite its popularity, empirical research on the impact of FA on respondents' answering behavior is scarce and has generated mixed findings. In fact, some quasi-experimental studies showed that FA has detrimental consequences such as increased survey dropout rates and faking behavior. Notably, a theoretical psychological process driving these effects has hitherto not been identified. Therefore, the aim of the present study was twofold: First, we sought to experimentally replicate detrimental effects of FA on online questionnaire data quality. Second, we tried to uncover an explanatory psychological mechanism. Specifically, we hypothesized that FA effects are mediated through reactance. Zero-order effects showed that FA increased state reactance and questionnaire dropout as well as it reduced answer length in open-ended questions. Results of survival and mediation analyses corroborate negative FA effects on data quality and the proposed psychological process.},

This paper presents an end-to-end framework to automate detection of disinformation narratives, networks, and influential actors. The framework integrates natural language processing, machine learning, graph analytics, and a novel network causal inference approach to quantify the impact of individual actors in spreading IO narratives. We demonstrate its capability on real-world hostile IO campaigns with Twitter datasets collected during the 2017 French presidential elections, and known IO accounts disclosed by Twitter over a broad range of IO campaigns (May 2007 to February 2020), over 50,000 accounts, 17 countries, and different account types including both trolls and bots. Our system detects IO accounts with 96\% precision, 79\% recall, and 96\% area-under-the-PR-curve, maps out salient network communities, and discovers high-impact accounts that escape the lens of traditional impact statistics based on activity counts and network centrality. Results are corroborated with independent sources of known IO accounts from U.S. Congressional reports, investigative journalism, and IO datasets provided by Twitter.},

Public opinion polls show rising levels of concer about privacy among Americans. Against this backdrop, research into issues associated with information privacy is increasing. Based on a number of preliminary studies, it has become apparent that organizational practices, individuals' perceptions of these practices, and societal responses are inextricably linked in many ways. Theories regarding these relationships are slowly emerging. Unfortunately, researchers attempting to examine such relationships through confirmatory empirical approaches may be impeded by the lack of validated instruments for measuring individuals' concerns about organizational information privacy practices. To enable future studies in the information privacy research stream, we developed and validated an instrument that identifies and measures the primary dimensions of individuals' concers about organizational information privacy practices. The development process included examinations of privacy literature; experience surveys and focus groups; and the use of expert judges. The result was a parsimonious 15-item instrument with four subscales tapping into dimensions of individuals' concerns about organizational information privacy practices. The instrument was rigorously tested and validated across several heterogenous populations, providing a high degree of confidence in the scales' validity, reliability, and generalizability.},

Studies showing that humans prefer to interact with cooperative others is often cited as support for partner choice driving the evolution of cooperation. However, these studies are largely drawn from Western samples, where conditions for partner choice to operate may be especially favorable. Here, we investigate qualities associated with being a preferred partner (i.e., campmate) in Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania in 2016 and 2019. A total of 156 Hadza participants from 17 camps ranked their campmates on generosity, foraging ability, and their preference for them as future campmates. In 2016, Hadza preferred more generous people and better hunters as campmates, with evidence suggesting a stronger preference for better hunters; however, the relationship between generosity and being a preferred campmate was greater in 2019 than in 2016, such that the preference for generous people was stronger than the preference for better foragers, suggesting that campmate preferences are changing. These new findings contrast with reports on data from nearly a decade ago, suggesting that the Hadza do not prefer more cooperative campmates. Further, in 2019, there was anecdotal evidence that Hadza with greater exposure to outside cultural institutions (e.g., schooling, having a job, or living in a village) had a stronger preference for generous campmates than those with less exposure. Taken together, the results suggest that preferences for social partners may, in part, be culturally shaped.},

Against this background, and drawing on information systems and consumer research, the current research investigates how the mere presence of messaging services on websites influences website users' privacy concerns. The results of two online experiments reveal that the presence of CUI evokes perceptions of a social presence that translate into perceptions of being watched, thus positively influencing the privacy concern. The findings of this study extend the those of previous research by revealing that perceived social presence elicited by the presence of CUI also yields negative effects.

In this review, we employ the input\textendash mediator\textendash outcome (IMO) team effectiveness framework to organize a systematic and comprehensive review of the knowledge accumulated in this area during the last three decades. The use of the IMO framework highlights important aspects of team dynamics that have received limited attention in past studies. Building on our analysis of the literature, we discuss significant theoretical questions that remain to be answered and propose methodological changes that would broaden and enhance our current understanding of team information processing. We suggest that the hidden-profile paradigm has reached maturity in terms of the permutations of Stasser and Titus's original conceptualization and conclude by proposing that future research should move toward exploring novel settings that move closer toward embracing the dynamic and complex nature of team information processing.},

Online interactions among people span geographical boundaries and interweave with different human life activities. However, current OSNs identification schemes lack guarantees on quantifying the trustworthiness of online identities of users joining them. Therefore, driven from the need to empower users with an identity validation scheme, we introduce a novel model, cooperative and adaptive decentralized identity validation CADIVa, that allows OSN users to assign trust levels to whomever they interact with. CADIVa exploits association rule mining approach to extract the identity correlations among profile attributes in every individual community in a social network. CADIVa is a fully decentralized and adaptive model that exploits fully decentralized learning and cooperative approaches not only to preserve users privacy, but also to increase the system reliability and to make it resilient to mono-failure. CADIVa follows the ensemble learning paradigm to preserve users privacy and employs gossip protocols to achieve efficient and low-overhead communication. We provide two different implementation scenarios of CADIVa. Results confirm CADIVa's ability to provide fine-grained community-aware identity validation with average improvement up to 36 and 50~\% compared to the semi-centralized or global approaches, respectively. \textcopyright{} 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

However, such convenience comes at the price of making legitimate users subject to different threats created by fake accounts. Therefore, there is a crucial need to empower users with tools helping them in assigning a level of trust to whomever they interact with. To cope with this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel model, DIVa, that leverages on mining techniques to find correlations among user profile attributes. These correlations are discovered not from user population as a whole, but from individual communities, where the correlations are more pronounced. DIVa exploits a decentralized learning approach and ensures privacy preservation as each node in the OSN independently processes its local data and is required to know only its direct neighbors. Extensive experiments using real-world OSN datasets show that DIVa is able to extract fine-grained community-aware correlations among profile attributes with average improvements up to 50\% than the global approach. \textcopyright{} 2015 ACM.},

The self-categorization explanation of influence grounded in group norms, moderated by group identification, is compared and contrasted to other normative explanations of influence, notably the concept of injunctive norms and the relation to moral conviction. A range of moderating factors relating to individual variation, features of the intragroup and intergroup context, and important contextual variables (i.e., anonymity versus visibility, isolation versus copresence) that are particularly relevant to online influence in the new media are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {Social sites frequently ask for rich sets of user identity properties before granting access. Users are given the freedom to fail to respond to some of these requests, or can choose to submit fake identity properties, so as to reduce the risk of identification, surveillance or observation of any kind. However, this freedom has led to serious security and privacy incidents [23], due to the role users' identities play in establishing social and privacy settings. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this open problem, by analyzing the dynamics of social identity verification protocols. We use a game theoretical framework to describe a simple two-player general sum game describing the behavior of a server system (like Facebook) that provides utility to users. Users can choose to register a new identity using the true information, false information or no information (and remain anonymous). Likewise, the server may choose to believe and add the prospective social user, believe and yet fail the registration, or do nothing. We show criteria on the relative payoff of providing no information (anonymity) that produce various Nash equilibria. We then show that in the presence of a binding agreement to cooperate, most players will agree to share information. This result is consistent with reality, and suggests that sites that require users to authenticate with identity information should be prepared to provide strong guarantees on privacy in order to ensure that a social contract is maintained and the sites are not damaged. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an analytical model is developed to study the dynamics underpinning users' registration is social media.},

One of the main challenges coming from this platform is approximating a Nash Equilibrium (NE) over zero-sum matrix games. While the problem of computing such a Nash Equilibrium is solvable in polynomial time using Linear Programming (LP), it rapidly becomes infeasible to solve as the size of the matrix grows; a situation commonly encountered in games. This paper focuses on improving the approximation of a NE for matrix games such that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms given a finite (and rather small) number {$\mathsl{T}$}TT of oracle requests to rewards. To reach this objective, we propose to share information between the different relevant pure strategies. We show both theoretically by improving the bound and empirically by experiments on artificial matrices and on a real-world game that information sharing leads to an improvement of the approximation of the NE.},

Given the potential backlash of consumers, it is imperative that both researchers and practitioners understand the nature of consumers' concern for information privacy and accurately model the construct within evolving research and business contexts. Drawing upon a sample of 355 consumers and working within the framework of confirmatory factor analysis, this study examines the factor structure of the concern for information privacy (CFIP) instrument posited by Smith et al. (1996). Consistent with prior findings, the results suggest that each dimension of this instrument is reliable and distinct. However, the results also suggest that CFIP may be more parsimoniously represented as a higher-order factor structure rather than a correlated set of first-order factors. The implication of these results is that each dimension of CFIP as well as the supra dimension derived from the associations among dimensions are important in capturing CFIP and associating the construct to other important antecedents and consequences.},

It can be constrained by social networks1\textendash 3 and distorted by zealots and automated bots4. Here we develop a voter game as a model system to study information flow in collective decisions. Players are assigned to competing groups (parties) and placed on an `influence network' that determines whose voting intentions each player can observe. Players are incentivized to vote according to partisan interest, but also to coordinate their vote with the entire group. Our mathematical analysis uncovers a phenomenon that we call information gerrymandering: the structure of the influence network can sway the vote outcome towards one party, even when both parties have equal sizes and each player has the same influence. A small number of zealots, when strategically placed on the influence network, can also induce information gerrymandering and thereby bias vote outcomes. We confirm the predicted effects of information gerrymandering in social network experiments with n~=~2,520 human subjects. Furthermore, we identify extensive information gerrymandering in real-world influence networks, including online political discussions leading up to the US federal elections, and in historical patterns of bill co-sponsorship in the US Congress and European legislatures. Our analysis provides an account of the vulnerabilities of collective decision-making to systematic distortion by restricted information flow. Our analysis also highlights a group-level social dilemma: information gerrymandering can enable one party to sway decisions in its favour, but when multiple parties engage in gerrymandering the group loses its ability to reach consensus and remains trapped in deadlock.},

We generated transcripts of 11,163 utterances using automatic speech recognition, which were then coded by trained humans for evidence of the three CPS facets. We used both standard and deep sequential learning classifiers to model the human-coded facets from linguistic, task context, facial expressions, and acoustic\textendash prosodic features in a team-independent fashion. We found that models relying on nonverbal signals yielded above-chance accuracies (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUROC) ranging from .53 to .83, with increases in model accuracy when language information was included (AUROCS from .72 to .86). There were no advantages of deep sequential learning methods over standard classifiers. Overall, Random Forest classifiers using language and task context features performed best, achieving AUROC scores of .86, .78, and .79 for construction of shared knowledge, negotiation/coordination, and maintaining team function, respectively. We discuss application of our work to real-time systems that assess CPS and intervene to improve CPS outcomes.},

Recent models predict selection for false positives as the inevitable result of pressure to publish, even when scientists are penalized for publications that fail to replicate. We model the cultural evolution of research practices when laboratories are allowed to expend effort on theory, enabling them, at a cost, to identify hypotheses that are more likely to be true, before empirical testing. Theory can restore high effort in research practice and suppress false positives to a technical minimum, even without replication. The mere ability to choose between two sets of hypotheses, one with greater prior chance of being correct, promotes better science than can be achieved with effortless access to the set of stronger hypotheses. Combining theory and replication can have synergistic effects. On the basis of our analysis, we propose four simple recommendations to promote good science.},

  abstract = {Complex social behaviors lie at the heart of many of the challenges facing evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, and beyond. For evolutionary biologists the question is often how group behaviors such as collective action, or decision making that accounts for memories of past experience, can emerge and persist in an evolving system. Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for formalizing these questions and admitting them to rigorous study. Here we develop such a framework to study the evolution of sustained collective action in multi-player public-goods games, in which players have arbitrarily long memories of prior rounds of play and can react to their experience in an arbitrary way. We construct a coordinate system for memory-m strategies in iterated n-player games that permits us to characterize all cooperative strategies that resist invasion by any mutant strategy, and stabilize cooperative behavior. We show that, especially when groups are small, longer-memory strategies make cooperation easier to evolve, by increasing the number of ways to stabilize cooperation. We also explore the co-evolution of behavior and memory. We find that even when memory has a cost, longer-memory strategies often evolve, which in turn drives the evolution of cooperation, even when the benefits for cooperation are low.},

  abstract = {At the present time, consumers often disclose their privacy when using online platforms to receive personalized recommendation information and services, but they are also highly concerned whether their privacy is being violated. ``Privacy paradox'' is becoming a hot topic of research. What are the potential impacts of individual cognitive differences and situational cues on privacy decision-making? How to balance the internal causes of the ``privacy paradox'' so that consumers are more willing to accept personalized recommendation services based on users' privacy data? Can the transparency of privacy rights ease user conflict perceptions and promote disclosure intentions? These questions are inconclusive. Therefore, the purpose of this our research was to explore consumer privacy paradoxical behaviors from a novel perspective of the characteristics of authorization cues, and to clarify the internal relationship between individual cognitive processing and privacy authorization cues. This study suggests that the big data platform, when collecting or using user information, should try to reduce the behaviors that induce users' resistance. It also provides a reference for how to better achieve benign interaction in personalized recommendation between Internet companies and users. The event-related potential technique is adopted to explore the matching relationship between individual cognitive processing and privacy authorization cues and to analyze the internal neural mechanism of the personalized recommendation user in the authorization decision. The experiment simulated the privacy authorization situation, and adopted a 2 \texttimes{} 2 \texttimes{} 2 hybrid experimental design: authority sensitivity (high/low) * authorization transparency (with/without permission) * cognitive style (field dependent/field independent). The experimental results show that: (1) Authorization transparency, authority sensitivity and their interactions will affect the user's privacy authorization behaviors, and the interaction of the two cues has a greater impact on the behavior than the role of a single cue; (2) The cognitive style will affect the individual's attention resource allocation in the authorization scenario, which, limited by cognitive resources, will result in selective attention to contextual cues: Compared with the field-independent group with self-characterization as a reference, the field-dependent group induced a greater P2 amplitude; (3) When the two-cue valences in the authoritative scenario are inconsistent, the amplitude of the N2 component is greater than that when the valences are consistent, and the amplitude of the N2 induced by the field-dependent group is more affected by the scenario cue valence; (4) Regardless of whether it is a field-dependent group or a field-independent group, there is no salient difference in the amplitude of LPP components induced in each scenario. According to the results of this study, even if privacy authorization involves high risks, individuals tend to selectively seek supportive cues or avoid obtaining information that is inconsistent with their cognition. This research reveals the differences of neural mechanisms in users' actual decision-making, provides the possibility for further exploration of the black box behind users' attitudes and behaviors, and opens up new ideas for the study of the ``privacy paradox.''}

Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a configurational decision tree model (CDTM) for precisely understanding individuals' decision-making process of privacy disclosure. A survey of location-based social network service (LBSNS) users was conducted to collect data, and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was adopted to validate the hypotheses. Findings: This paper identified two configurations for high and low disclosure, respectively, and found that the benefits and the risks did not function independently but interdependently, and the justice would play a crucial role when both the benefits and the risks were high. Furthermore, the authors found that there were asymmetric mechanisms for high disclosure and low disclosure, and males focused more on perceived usefulness, while females concerned more about perceived enjoyment, privacy risks and perceived justice. Originality/value: This paper further extends privacy calculus model (PCM) and deepens the understanding of the privacy calculus process from a configurational perspective. In addition, this study also provides guidance for future research on how to adopt the configurational approach with qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to revise and improve relevant theories for information systems (IS) behavioral research. \textcopyright{} 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We report on experiments with human participants in different conditions of the payoff matrix, which reflects game structures, and the speed of each player, which reflects the ability to change her social relationship. We show that cooperative relationships emerge in real human groups regardless of experimental settings, and show their basic behavioral patterns. We further discuss relationships between behavioral characters of participants in the experiments and their psychological characters to see how their personalities can be reflected in their behavior in such a game theoretical framework, and show that a few psychological characters of participants might reflect their behavioral characters at least in part, but there were variations in these relationships between experimental groups.},

However, current methods for measuring the CPS processes of individuals, such as coding and counting, treat these processes as sets of isolated and independent events. In contrast, Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) models how the contributions of a given individual relate to the contributions of others. This article examines the communications of air defense warfare teams from an experiment comparing two different computer-based decision support systems, using this data to ask whether ENA provides a more ecologically valid quantitative model of CPS than coding and counting. Qualitative analysis showed that commanders using one system asked questions to understand the tactical situation, while commanders using an experimental system focused more on actions in response to the tactical situation. Neither of the coding and counting approaches we tested corroborated these findings with statistically significant results. In contrast, ENA created models of the individual contributions of commanders that (a) showed statistical differences between commanders using the two systems to corroborate the qualitative analysis, and (b) revealed differences in individual performance. This suggests that ENA is a more powerful tool for CPS assessment than coding and counting approaches. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This raises serious privacy issues as these friends are not notified by the applications nor by Facebook and they have not given consent. This paper presents a detailed multi-faceted study on the collateral information collection of the applications on Facebook. To investigate the views of the users, we designed a questionnaire and collected the responses of 114 participants. The results show that participants are concerned about the collateral information collection and in particular about the lack of notification and of mechanisms to control the data collection. Based on real data, we compute the likelihood of collateral information collection affecting users: we show that the probability is significant and greater than 80\% for popular applications such as TripAdvisor. We also demonstrate that a substantial amount of profile data can be collected by applications, which enables application providers to profile users. To investigate whether collateral information collection is an issue to users' privacy we analysed the legal framework in light of the new General Data Protection Regulation. We provide a detailed analysis of the entities involved and investigate which entity is accountable for the collateral information collection. To provide countermeasures, we propose a privacy dashboard extension that implements privacy scoring computations to enhance transparency towards collateral information collection. Furthermore, we discuss alternative solutions highlighting other countermeasures such as notification and access control mechanisms, cryptographic solutions and application auditing. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that provides a detailed multi-faceted study of this problem and that analyses the threat of user profiling by application providers.},

It adds to the existing literature by combining experimental features from recent work in the trust game. We use random variations in the multiplier value, a third player without an initial endowment, undisclosed termination rules, and variations in information availability related to transactions. Our framework is novel in that the game continues even if the first player transfers no amount to the second player. Using participants from India, the results are broadly consistent with past evidence on the trust game. All players are more trusting when information of their transfers and earnings are made available to other players. The third player (termed the "trust broker") transfers a larger amount when information on transfers is disclosed to other players. We find that information availability leads to a significant increase in the trust broker's reciprocity, as defined by the amount that is returned to Player 2. Social desirability, cultural contexts, and learning effects are discussed in terms of scope for future research.},

  abstract = {Understanding the role of network structure in the evolution of cooperation is a key research goal at the intersection between physics and biology. Recent studies have particularly focused on multiplex networks given that multiple social domains are interrelated and cannot be represented by single-layer networks. However, the role of network multiplexity is not fully understood when combined with another important network characteristic: network dynamics. In the present study, we investigated evolutionary prisoner's dilemma games played on dynamic two-layer multiplex networks in which the payoff combined across the two layers determined strategy evolution. In addition, we introduced network dynamics where agents can sever links with defecting neighbors and construct new links. Our simulation showed that link updating enhances cooperation but the resultant states are far from those of full cooperation. This modest enhancement in cooperation was related to symmetry breaking whereby the cooperation frequency in one layer disproportionately increased while that in the other layer remained the same or even diminished. However, this broken symmetry disappeared with sufficiently fast link updating. Our results show that the introduction of network dynamics enhances cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma as previously reported, but this enhancement is accompanied by significant asymmetry once network multiplexity is considered. \textcopyright{} 2020},

Methods: In this study, a survey was conducted with 710 Chinese WeChat users to determine how they perceive the monetary value of their PI. Results: The survey results demonstrate that the ``endowment effect'' exists among Chinese web users, indicating different allocations of PI property rights may elicit distinct outcomes. The results also reveal that Chinese web users' willingness-to-pay (WTP) is mainly driven by privacy concern and intimacy of disclosure, and their willingness-to-accept (WTA) is mainly driven by privacy concern, intimacy of disclosure and psychological ownership. Conclusion: The results imply that market players in China can use these driving factors to increase consumers' valuation of their PI to maintain a stable user base, and a portion of users will choose paid but privacy-guaranteed services to protect their PI. Furthermore, our findings indicate that when there is a formal monetary PI market, a privacy class may emerge. \textcopyright{} 2021 Tang and Wang.},

Using computational models that combine inter-trial learning and intra-trial choice, we find transient effects of participants' preferences on the learning process, through the influence of priors, and persistent effects on the choice process. A second experiment shows that these effects generalize to non-social learning, though participants in the social learning experiment appeared to additionally benefit by using their knowledge about the popularity of certain preferences.

  abstract = {This paper introduces a platform for online Sensitivity Analysis (SA) that is applicable in large scale real-time data acquisition (DAQ) systems. Here we use the term real-time in the context of a system that has to respond to externally generated input stimuli within a finite and specified period. Complex industrial systems such as manufacturing, healthcare, transport, and finance require high quality information on which to base timely responses to events occurring in their volatile environments. The motivation for the proposed EventTracker platform is the assumption that modern industrial systems are able to capture data in real-time and have the necessary technological flexibility to adjust to changing system requirements. The flexibility to adapt can only be assured if data is succinctly interpreted and translated into corrective actions in a timely manner. An important factor that facilitates data interpretation and information modelling is an appreciation of the affect system inputs have on each output at the time of occurrence. Many existing sensitivity analysis methods appear to hamper efficient and timely analysis due to a reliance on historical data, or sluggishness in providing a timely solution that would be of use in real-time applications. This inefficiency is further compounded by computational limitations and the complexity of some existing models. In dealing with real-time event driven systems, the underpinning logic of the proposed method is based on the assumption that in the vast majority of cases changes in input variables will trigger events. Every single or combination of events could subsequently result in a change to the system state. The proposed event tracking sensitivity analysis method describes variables and the system state as a collection of events. The higher the numeric occurrence of an input variable at the trigger level during an event monitoring interval, the greater is its impact on the final analysis of the system state. Experiments were designed to compare the proposed event tracking sensitivity analysis method with a comparable method (that of Entropy). An improvement of 10\% in computational efficiency without loss in accuracy was observed. The comparison also showed that the time taken to perform the sensitivity analysis was 0.5\% of that required when using the comparable Entropy based method.},

Information that users share about one another has great impacts on impression formation, but also poses risks to the privacy of both users and non-users. Particularly, information disclosed by others (other-generated disclosure) is less deceptive and more credible than self-disclosure, challenges one's desired self-presentation as well as self-image, and can cause face threats. So far, privacy literature on OSNs has focused on self-disclosure, and little attention has been paid to other-generated disclosure. Given this growing and increasingly important phenomenon, this present study explores other- generated disclosures, based on the lived experiences of adult Facebook users, to fill this gap. Using an online survey, results shows that Facebook users are likely to be exposed to other-generated disclosure not only through tags and photos but also posts and comments. Posts and comments are increasingly problematic. Not only will this study be useful for service providers in designing new features and improving privacy controls, but it also benefits organisations who take advantage of viral marketing and electronic word of mouth (eWOM), but in ways that seek to preserve the privacy of individuals. Furthermore, this study increases users' privacy awareness and promotes meaningful online privacy practices to preserve not only privacy of individuals, but also privacy of engaging parties, due to the domino effect of interdependent privacy.},

However, these models have led to conflicting interpretations of behaviour and underlying psychological dynamics. Here, we propose that flexible, goal-directed deployment of attention towards information priorities provides a more parsimonious account of altruistic choice dynamics. We demonstrate that time pressure tends to produce early gaze-biases towards a person's own outcomes, and that individual differences in this bias explain how individuals' generosity changes under time pressure. Our gaze-informed drift-diffusion model incorporating moment-to-moment eye-gaze further reveals that underlying social preferences both drive attention, and interact with it to shape generosity under time pressure. These findings help explain existing inconsistencies in the field by emphasizing the role of dynamic attention-allocation during altruistic choice. \textcopyright{} 2020, The Author(s).},

However, theoretical and empirical integration of the vast literature on the predictive validity of personality traits to account for these individual differences is missing. Here, we present a theoretical framework that identifies 4 broad situational affordances across interdependent situations (i.e., exploitation, reciprocity, temporal conflict, and dependence under uncertainty) and more specific subaffordances within certain types of interdependent situations (e.g., possibility to increase equality in outcomes) that can determine when, which, and how personality traits should be expressed in prosocial behavior. To test this framework, we meta-analyzed 770 studies reporting on 3,523 effects of 8 broad and 43 narrow personality traits on prosocial behavior in interdependent situations modeled in 6 commonly studied economic games (Dictator Game, Ultimatum Game, Trust Game, Prisoner's Dilemma, Public Goods Game, and Commons Dilemma). Overall, meta-analytic correlations ranged between -.18 {$\leq$} p {$\leq$} .26, and most traits yielding a significant relation to prosocial behavior had conceptual links to the affordances provided in interdependent situations, most prominently the possibility for exploitation. Moreover, for several traits, correlations within games followed the predicted pattern derived from a theoretical analysis of affordances. On the level of traits, we found that narrow and broad traits alike can account for prosocial behavior, informing the bandwidth-fidelity problem. In sum, the meta-analysis provides a theoretical foundation that can guide future research on prosocial behavior and advance our understanding of individual differences in human prosociality. \textcopyright{} 2019 American Psychological Association.},

We examine the complementary puzzle of mutualism, in which actors can benefit each other simultaneously, and the psychology of coordination, which ensures such benefits. Coordination is facilitated by common knowledge: the recursive belief state in which A knows X, B knows X, A knows that B knows X, B knows that A knows X, ad infinitum. We test whether people are sensitive to common knowledge when deciding whether to engage in risky coordination. Participants decided between working alone for a certain profit and working together for a potentially higher profit that they would receive only if their partner made the same choice. Results showed that more participants attempted risky coordination when they and their prospective partner had common knowledge of the payoffs (broadcast over a loudspeaker) than when they had only shared knowledge (conveyed to both by a messenger) or private knowledge (revealed to each partner separately). These results support the hypothesis that people represent common knowledge as a distinct cognitive category that licenses them to coordinate with others for mutual gain. We discuss how this hypothesis can provide a unified explanation for diverse phenomena in human social life, including recursive mentalizing, performative speech acts, public protests, hypocrisy, and self-conscious emotional expressions.

We review existing research on these topics and present new data to address these concerns. We find that insufficient attention is no more a problem among MTurk samples than among other commonly used convenience or high-quality commercial samples, and that MTurk participants buy into interactive experiments and trust researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies. Furthermore, we find that employing rigorous exclusion methods consistently boosts statistical power without introducing problematic side effects (e.g., substantially biasing the post-exclusion sample), and can thus provide a general solution for dealing with problematic respondents across samples.

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper contrasts the determinants of online disclosures about self and others in social media. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 216 respondents were collected through an online survey. The formal research model was tested with covariance based structural equation modeling. Findings: The determinants of online disclosures vary whether the subject is self or others. Social networking site (SNS) users who self-disclose are also more likely to share information about others. Furthermore, there are significant gender effects in the influences of disclosure as revealed by multi-group SEM. Research limitations/implications: Future research models should incorporate the construct of disclosure about others and examine the intertwining of different types of disclosure on SNS. Future work should include behavioral measures, as this study relied on self-report measures. Practical implications: The current understanding of information sharing does not accommodate different forms of disclosure. Employers or systems administrators concerned about data sharing may need to tailor interventions to the subject of the disclosure. Furthermore, the significant gender differences in determinants of disclosure suggest that this should be considered in practical applications. Originality/value: Disclosure about others has not been examined in prior work. This study contributes by offering empirical data on the contrasting determinants of disclosure as well as gender differences. It improves the understanding of online information sharing, a topic of particular relevance in today's information oriented society. \textcopyright{} 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Health and safety, environment, and comfort are the three main aspects of residential buildings that have been tested during quarantines and are also expected to experience major transformations toward sustainability. Residential houses should provide certain health and safety protective measures to their occupants, such as the application of new touchless technologies, having proper sanitation to diminish the probability of getting infected, and developing greener and more intimate spaces that can help recover and improve mental states. Our findings address the need to reconsider sustainability requirements for residential buildings, which will provide adequate health and safety and comfort with no significant harm to the environment.},

Information was distributed in order to create a hidden profile so that disconfirmation of group members' initial preferences was required to solve the task. Experiment 1 revealed that competition, compared to cooperation, led group members to withhold unshared information, a difference that was not significant for shared information. In competition, compared to cooperation, group members were also more reluctant to disconfirm their initial preferences. Decision quality was lower in competition than in cooperation, this effect being mediated by disconfirmation use and not by information sharing. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and revealed the role of mistrust in predicting strategic information sharing and use in competition. These results support a motivated information processing approach of group decision making.},

Substantial progress has been made in building models of the processes involved, and identifying underlying neural mechanisms using simple, two-alternative forced choice decision tasks. However, less attention has been given to how social information influences these processes, and the neural systems that mediate this influence. Here we sought to address these questions by using tasks similar to ones that have been used to study individual decision making behavior, and adding conditions in which participants were given trial-by-trial information about the performance of other individuals (their choices and/or their rewards) simultaneously playing the same tasks. We asked two questions: How does such information about the behavior of others influence performance in otherwise simple decision tasks, and what neural systems mediate this influence? We found that bilateral insula exhibited a parametric relationship to the degree of misalignment of the individual's performance with those of others in the group. Furthermore, activity in the bilateral insula significantly predicted participants' subsequent choices to align their behavior with others in the group when they were misaligned either in their choices (independent of success) or their degree of success (independent of specific choices). These findings add to the growing body of empirical data suggesting that the insula participates in an important way in social information processing and decision making.},

  abstract = {Variational Bayes (VB), also known as independent mean-field approximation, has become a popular method for Bayesian network inference in recent years. Its application is vast, e.g. in neural network, compressed sensing, clustering, etc. to name just a few. In this paper, the independence constraint in VB will be relaxed to a conditional constraint class, called copula in statistics. Since a joint probability distribution always belongs to a copula class, the novel copula VB (CVB) approximation is a generalized form of VB. Via information geometry, we will see that CVB algorithm iteratively projects the original joint distribution to a copula constraint space until it reaches a local minimum Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. By this way, all mean-field approximations, e.g. iterative VB, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Iterated Conditional Mode (ICM) and k-means algorithms, are special cases of CVB approximation. For a generic Bayesian network, an augmented hierarchy form of CVB will also be designed. While mean-field algorithms can only return a locally optimal approximation for a correlated network, the augmented CVB network, which is an optimally weighted average of a mixture of simpler network structures, can potentially achieve the globally optimal approximation for the first time. Via simulations of Gaussian mixture clustering, the classification's accuracy of CVB will be shown to be far superior to that of state-of-the-art VB, EM and k-means algorithms.},

Here, we identify the neurohormone oxytocin as pivotal to the neurobiological regulation of this tension in distinctly different group-living vertebrates, including fish, birds, rodents, non-human primates, and humans. In the context of intergroup conflict, a review of emerging work on pro-sociality suggests that oxytocin and its fish and birds homologs, isotocin and mesotocin, respectively, can elicit participation in group conflict and aggression. This is because it amplifies (i) concern for the interests of genetically related or culturally similar `in- group' others, and (ii) willingness to defend against outside intruders and enemy conspecifics. Across a range of social vertebrates, oxytocin can induce aggressive behaviour to `tend-and- defend' the in-group during intergroup contests.},

In so doing, many are partnering with third-party commercial companies to provide novel data processing and analysis capabilities, while also providing personal health information to a for-profit industry that may store and sell data. In this research we describe the public's comfort with sharing health data with third-party commercial companies for patient and business purposes and how this comfort is associated with demographic factors (sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, employment, income, insurance status, and self-reported health status), perceived healthcare access, and concerns about privacy. We surveyed the US public (n\,=\,1841) to assess comfort with sharing health data with third-party commercial companies for patient or business purposes and examined whether there was a difference between comfort with data sharing for patient or business purposes. Univariate and stepwise regression modeling is used here to estimate the relationship between comfort with third-party commercial companies for patient and business purposes (outcomes) and demographic factors, self-reported health status, perceived healthcare access, and privacy concerns. The public is more comfortable sharing health data with third party commercial companies for patient purposes as compared to business purposes (paired t\,=\,39.84, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Higher education was associated with greater comfort with sharing health data for patient purposes ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.205, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and decreased comfort with sharing health data for business purposes ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.145, p\,=\,0.079). An inverse relationship exists between privacy concerns and comfort with sharing health data for both patient ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.223, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and business purposes ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.246, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Participants ages 45\textendash 59 were less comfortable sharing health data with third party commercial companies for patient purposes ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.154, p\,=\,0.0012) than participants aged 18\textendash 29. Proactive acknowledgment of privacy concerns and better communication of the steps being taken to protect the privacy of health data can increase patient comfort. Healthcare systems may be able to increase public and patient comfort with sharing health data with third-party commercial companies by emphasizing the patient-centered benefits of these partnerships.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at considering novel and practical applications of ALife techniques to design a co-creative social dynamics in an online and virtual space, which is becoming important because of the recent emergence of various types of online communication platforms due to outbreaks of COVID19. Recently, spatial and online communication services, such as SpatialChat, have attracted more attention. Each participant is represented as an avatar or icon in a virtual 2D space. She can move it around in the space and listen to neighbors' voices of which volume become louder as they get closer to her. However, the overall structure of communications tends to be deadlocked, which might make participants lose chances to communicate with many other people. We design and investigate a virtual agent, called ``facilitator agent,'' as a study towards realization of practical agents that facilitate novel and cooperative interactions in a spatial and online communication by giving human participants opportunities to communicate with many others cooperatively. We adopt a Social Particle Swarm (SPS) model to simulate group dynamics in this type of communication service. We assume several behavioral patterns of a facilitator agent with fixed game-theoretical strategies and several movement strategies. We discuss how incorporating a single facilitator agent into the space can increase novel and cooperative interactions in several behavioral settings of the facilitator agent. We also report on a preliminary experiment on designing a facilitator agent using a deep reinforcement learning technique.},

By tracking the mouse movements and clicks, designers can evaluate the usefulness and ease of use of their web applications in order to enhance user experience. In today's highly competitive web marketplace, mouse tracking can reveal significant benefits for web marketing issues, since it can be used to analyze user behavior, so as we developers can design web environments to attract and win over the user (web consumer). However, simple mouse tracking is not enough since user behavior in web is multifold and e influenced by human factors such as gender, age, expectations, experience etc. Hence, mouse tracking should be used in compliance to human factor analysis and user behavioral (e.g. motivation, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, playfulness, etc) research. In this paper we address the role of two key human factors' derived behavioral attributes: self-efficacy and risk perception, and we analyze their influence on the user experience and user performance (i.e. the achievement of the desired task) while interacting with web software applications. We present the mouse tracking patterns that have been realized so far to measure these two attributes, and we conduct our own experiment by designing a prototype mouse tracking tool to measure user hesitation.

The effect of panelists' demographics on bid values and auction winners, and the impact of experimental procedures on auction prices are analyzed. Demographic variables are poor predictors of bids and auction winners. Experimental procedures such as panel size and initial endowment influence market price level. Relative bid differences for paired samples are primarily influenced by relative differences in taste panel ratings. Relative willingness-to-pay values elicited through experimental auctions appear valid, while actual willingness-to-pay values are influenced by experimental design.},

  abstract = {Real-world agents, humans as well as animals, observe each other during interactions and choose their own actions taking the partners' ongoing behaviour into account. Yet, classical game theory assumes that players act either strictly sequentially or strictly simultaneously without knowing each other's current choices. To account for action visibility and provide a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints, we introduce a new game-theoretic setting called transparent games, where each player has a certain probability of observing the partner's choice before deciding on its own action. By means of evolutionary simulations, we demonstrate that even a small probability of seeing the partner's choice before one's own decision substantially changes the evolutionary successful strategies. Action visibility enhances cooperation in an iterated coordination game, but reduces cooperation in a more competitive iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. In both games, ``Win\textendash stay, lose\textendash shift'' and ``Tit-for-tat'' strategies are predominant for moderate transparency, while a ``Leader-Follower'' strategy emerges for high transparency. Our results have implications for studies of human and animal social behaviour, especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions.},

  abstract = {The processes underwriting the acquisition of culture remain unclear. How are shared habits, norms, and expectations learned and maintained with precision and reliability across large-scale sociocultural ensembles? Is there a unifying account of the mechanisms involved in the acquisition of culture? Notions such as 'shared expectations', the 'selective patterning of attention and behaviour', 'cultural evolution', 'cultural inheritance', and 'implicit learning' are the main candidates to underpin a unifying account of cognition and the acquisition of culture; however, their interactions require greater specification and clarification. In this paper, we integrate these candidates using the variational (free energy) approach to human cognition and culture in theoretical neuroscience. We describe the construction by humans of social niches that afford epistemic resources called cultural affordances. We argue that human agents learn the shared habits, norms, and expectations of their culture through immersive participation in patterned cultural practices that selectively pattern attention and behaviour. We call this process "Thinking through Other Minds" (TTOM) - in effect, the process of inferring other agents' expectations about the world and how to behave in social context. We argue that for humans, information from and about other people's expectations constitutes the primary domain of statistical regularities that humans leverage to predict and organize behaviour. The integrative model we offer has implications that can advance theories of cognition, enculturation, adaptation, and psychopathology. Crucially, this formal (variational) treatment seeks to resolve key debates in current cognitive science, such as the distinction between internalist and externalist accounts of Theory of Mind abilities and the more fundamental distinction between dynamical and representational accounts of enactivism.

To alleviate such concerns, shopping sites seek to employ interventions to encourage users to buy more online. Two common interventions used to promote online sales are: (1) recommendations that help customers choose the right product either based on historic purchase correlations or recommendations suggested by the retailer; and (2) discounts that increase the value of products. Building on privacy calculus, we theorize about how and why key, representative combinations of recommendations and discounts influence the effects of inhibitors and enablers on online purchase intention. Our research design incorporated recommendations coming from different sources for the recommendation (retailer and other customers' preferences) product relatedness (related products with historic purchases correlated to the focal product and unrelated products with no historic purchase correlation to the focal product) and two types of discounts (regular and bundle). Participants completed a browsing task in a controlled online shopping environment and completed a survey (n~=~496). We found mixed results of moderating effects of recommendations and product relatedness on the effect of inhibitors and enablers on purchase intention. Although recommendations did not enhance the effects of inhibitors, they did enhance the effects of enablers on online purchase intention. We also found that product relatedness did not enhance the effect of privacy enablers on online purchase intentions. The results also showed that discounts enhance the effects of enablers, and that discounts can counteract the moderating effect of recommendations on the relationship between inhibitors and purchase intention under certain circumstances. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.},

Consistent with some previous studies, we found significant correlations among some of the Dark Triad variables and between each of the Dark Triad variables and some of the Big 5. To the extent that these variables were correlated at the phenotypic level, these correlations were largely attributable to correlated genetic factors. At the univariate level, all traits showed the influence of genetic and non-shared environmental factors, with heritabilities ranging between .31 and .72; Machiavellianism alone also showed the influence of shared environmental factors.

Yet, cooperation is common in human societies, so there must be some features which make it evolutionarily advantageous. Using a cognitive inspired model of human cooperation, recent work Realpe-G\'omez (2018) has reported signatures of criticality in human cooperative groups. Theoretical evidence suggests that being poised at a critical point provides evolutionary advantages to groups by enhancing responsiveness of these systems to external attacks. After showing that signatures of criticality can be detected in human cooperative groups composed by Moody Conditional Cooperators, in this work we show that being poised close to a turning point enhances the fitness and make individuals more resistant to invasions by free riders.

In these cases, payment processes are more liquidated and automated leading to the paradigm shift in the payment industry. The advancement of Blockchain technology (BCT) tends to replace conventional payment methods in supply chain that may involve payment terms. However, when BCT is applied, some payment conditions can be met by adopting smart contracts; while other scenarios such as a payment in arrears have yet been addressed. For example, no payment solution is available for anticipated funds associated with contractual~dues. To improve the flexibility, we propose a new architecture based on smart contracts to lubricate the payments, and we evaluate the effectiveness of the architecture. The system has its great theoretic and practical significance since it creates the new technical thread that enterprises would be able to fully utilize future resources in current businesses.},

  abstract = {Public Goods Games (PGGs) are a standard experimental economic approach to studying cooperative behaviour. There are two types of games: discrete-time and continuous-time PGGs. While discrete-time PGGs (one-shot decisions about contributions to public goods) can be easily done as lab experiments, continuous-time PGGs (where participants can change contributions at any time) are much harder to realise within a lab environment. This is mainly because it is difficult to consider events happening in continuous time in lab experiments. Simulation offers an opportunity to support real-world lab experiments and is well suited to explore continuous-time PGGs. In this paper, we show how to apply our recently developed ABOOMS (Agent-Based Object-Oriented Modelling and Simulation) development framework to create models for simulation-supported continuous-time PGG studies. The ABOOMS framework utilizes Software Engineering techniques to support the development at the macro level (considering the overall study lifecycle) and at the micro level (considering individual steps related to simulation model development). Our case study shows that outputs from the simulation-supported continuous-time PGG generate dynamics that do not exist in discrete-time setting, highlighting the fact that it is important to study both, discrete and continuous-time PGGs.},

The adoption of one of the neighboring strategies is allowed with a probability dependent on the payoff difference. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to study how the measure of cooperation is affected by the number of hierarchical levels (Q) and by the temptation to defect. According to the simulations the highest frequency of cooperation can be observed at the top level if the number of hierarchical levels is low (Q{$<$}4) . For larger Q , however, the highest frequency of cooperators occurs in the middle layers. The four-level hierarchical structure provides the highest average (total) income for the whole community.},

  abstract = {In Agent-based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS), a system is modelled as a collection of agents, which are autonomous decision-making units with diverse characteristics. The interaction of the individual behaviours of the agents results in the global behaviour of the system. Because ABMS offers a methodology to create an artificial society in which actors with their behaviour can be designed and results of their interaction can be observed, it has gained attention in social sciences such as Economics, Ecology, Social Psychology, and Sociology. In Economics, ABMS has been used to model many strategic situations. One of the popular strategic situations is the Public Goods Game (PGG). In the PGG, participants secretly choose how many of their private money units to put into a public pot. Social scientists can conduct laboratory experiments of PGGs to study human behaviours in strategic situations. Research findings from these laboratory studies have inspired studies using computational agents and vice versa. However, there is a lack of guidelines regarding the detailed development process and the modelling of agent behaviour for agent-based models of PGGs. We believe that this has contributed to ABMS of PGG not having been used to its full potential. This thesis aims to leverage the potential of ABMS of PGG, focusing on the development methodology of ABMS and the modelling of agent behaviour. We construct a development framework with incorporated software engineering techniques, then tailored it to ABMS of PGG. The framework uses the Unified Modelling Language (UML) as a standard specification language, and includes a simulation development lifecycle, a step-by-step development guideline, and a short guide for modelling agent behaviour with statecharts. It utilizes software engineering methods to provide a structured approach to identify agent interactions, and design simulation architecture and agent behaviour. The framework is named ABOOMS (Agent-Based Object-Oriented Modelling and Simulation). After applying the ABOOMS framework to three case studies, the framework demonstrates flexibility in development with two different modelling principles (Keep-It-Simple-Stupid vs. Keep-It-Descriptive-Stupid), capability in supporting complex psychological mechanisms, and ability to model dynamic behaviours in both discrete and continuous time. Additionally, the thesis developed an agent-based model of a PGG in a continuous-time setting. To the best of our knowledge such agent-based models do not exist. During the development, a new social preference, Generous Conditional Cooperators, was introduced to better explain the behavioural dynamics in continuous-time PGG. Experimentation with the agent-based model generated dynamics that are not presented in discrete-time setting. Thus, it is important to study both discrete and continuous time PGG, with laboratory experiment and ABMS. Our new framework allows to do the latter in a structured way. With the ABOOMS framework, economists can develop PGG simulation models in a structured way and communicate them with a formal model specification. The thesis also showed that there is a need for further investigation on behaviours in continuous-time PGG. For future works, the framework can be tested with variations of PGG or other related strategic interactions.},

However, verbal theories of the mechanisms underlying ToM are often criticized as under-specified and mutually incompatible. This leads to measures of ToM being unreliable, to the extent that even canonical experimental tasks do not require representation of others' mental states. There have been attempts at making computational models of ToM, but these are not easily available for broad research application. In order to help meet these challenges, we here introduce the Python package tomsup: Theory of Mind Simulations Using Python. The package provides a computational eco-system for investigating and comparing computational models of hypothesized ToM mechanisms and for using them as experimental stimuli. The package notably includes an easy-to-use implementation of the variational recursive Bayesian k-ToM model developed by Devaine et al., 2014b and of simpler non-recursive decision models, for comparison. We provide a series of tutorials on how to: i) simulate agents relying on the k-ToM model and on a range of simpler types of mechanisms; ii) employ those agents to generate online experimental stimuli; iii) analyze the data generated in such experimental setup and iv) specify new custom ToM and heuristic cognitive models.},

  abstract = {Privacy and security concerns are pervasive because of the ease of access to information. Recurrent negative cases in the popular press attest to the failure of current privacy regulations to keep consumer and protected health information sufficiently secure in today's climate of increased IT use. One reason for such failure is that organizations violate these regulations for multiple reasons. To address this issue, we propose a theoretical model to explain the likelihood that organizations will select an externally governed privacy or security rule for violation in response to organizational strain or slack resources. Our proposed theoretical model, the selective organizational information privacy and security violations model (SOIPSVM), explains how organizational structures and processes, along with characteristics of regulatory rules, alter perceptions of risk when an organization's performance does not match its aspiration levels and thereby affects the likelihood of rule violations. Importantly, SOIPSVM is contextualized to organizational privacy and security violations. SOIPSVM builds on and extends the selective organizational rule violations model (SORVM), which posits that organizational rule violations are selective. SOIPSVM provides at least four contributions to the privacy and security literature that can further guide empirical research and practice. First, SOIPSVM introduces the concept of selectivity in rule violations to privacy and security research. This concept can improve privacy and security research by showing that organizational violations of privacy and security rules are dynamic and selective yet influenced by external forces. Second, SOIPSVM extends the boundaries of SORVM, which is limited to explaining the behavior of organizations under strain, such as economic hardship. We contribute to the theory of selective deviance by proposing that selectivity extends to organizations with slack resources. Third, we address ideas of non-economic risk and strain in addition to economic risk and strain. SOIPSVM thus explains organizational rule-violating behavior as an attempt to protect core organizational values from external entities that pressure organizations to change their values to comply with rules. Fourth, we broaden the theoretical scope of two important constructs, namely structural secrecy and procedural emphasis to improve the explanatory power of the model. Fifth, we identify important elements of rule enforcement by drawing from the tenets of general deterrence theory. We also discuss how constructs from general deterrence theory can be studied at the organizational level. To conclude, we offer recommendations for the structuring of organizations and external regulations to decrease organizational rule violations, which often lead to the abuse of consumer information.},

Although studies have begun to investigate the factors influencing social attachment, there is a lack of research on how perceived value affects social attachment. Therefore, this study uses privacy concern theory, to build a theoretical model with moderated and mediation roles, using Chinese Tik Tok users as data and survey sample, and applying Mplus7.0 to analyze the mediation mechanism and boundary conditions of the relationship between perceived value and social attachment through the structural equation model. In Study 1, data were collected from 600 Tik Tok users to verify the mediating role of the sense of belonging in perceived value and social attachment relationship. The users participating in the questionnaire survey were mainly from mainland China. In Study 2, two waves of data were collected from 500 Tik Tok users to verify the mediating role of the sense of belonging, and support part of the moderating role of privacy concern. However, except that the relationship between information value and social attachment is inhibited by privacy concern, the relationship between entertainment and social value and social attachment is not regulated by privacy concern. This research examines the practical effects of perceived value in the context of social media use, reveals the internal mechanism of the impact of perceived value on social attachment, and provides a reference for the innovative management and commercial practice of social media.},

In real-world prisoner's dilemmas, these choices are temporally extended and different strategies may correspond to sequences of actions, reflecting grades of cooperation. We introduce a Sequential Prisoner's Dilemma (SPD) game to better capture the aforementioned characteristics. In this work, we propose a deep multiagent reinforcement learning approach that investigates the evolution of mutual cooperation in SPD games. Our approach consists of two phases. The first phase is offline: it synthesizes policies with different cooperation degrees and then trains a cooperation degree detection network. The second phase is online: an agent adaptively selects its policy based on the detected degree of opponent cooperation. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in two representative SPD 2D games: the Apple-Pear game and the Fruit Gathering game. Experimental results show that our strategy can avoid being exploited by exploitative opponents and achieve cooperation with cooperative opponents.},

  abstract = {Social organizations, especially human society, rely on egalitarian social norm, which can be characterized by high levels of fairness, empathy and collective conformity. Nevertheless, the evolution of egalitarian social norm remains a conundrum, as it suffers the persistent challenge from individual self-interest. To address this issue, we construct an evolutionary game theoretical model by employing the Ultimatum Game, in which rational individuals are able to perform resource management. We show that resource management drives a population evolving into an oscillatory state with high equilibrium degrees of fairness, empathy and collective conformity and thus constitutes a key mechanism for the evolution of egalitarian social norm in social dilemma situations. Specifically, it results in (1) the formation of egalitarian social norm from diverse individual norms, (2) the emergence of egalitarian social norm in a selfish and unfair world, and (3) the maintenance of egalitarian social norm despite the presence of norm violators. The constructive role of resource management is explained by a mean-field analysis revealing that resource management can effectively enlarge the attraction basin of egalitarian norms or even change the dynamical property of the mini Ultimatum Game from bistability between egalitarian norms and less egalitarian norms to complete-dominance of egalitarian norms over less egalitarian norms. Furthermore, we find that the capacity of resource management can be evolutionarily selected by a coevolution between egalitarian social norm and resource management. Our study suggests that efficiency and equity are linked to each other. \textcopyright{} 2020 Wang et al.

We find that the stronger the bias in the utility function, the higher the level of public cooperation. Yet the benefits of enhanced public cooperation on the two networks are just as biased as the utility functions themselves. While cooperation may thrive on one network, the other may still be plagued by defectors. Nevertheless, the aggregate level of cooperation on both networks is higher than the one attainable on an isolated network. This positive effect of biased utility functions is due to the suppressed feedback of individual success, which leads to a spontaneous separation of characteristic time scales of the evolutionary process on the two interdependent networks. As a result, cooperation is promoted because the aggressive invasion of defectors is more sensitive to the slowing-down than the build-up of collective efforts in sizable groups.},

During the strategy update, the individual reputation is commonly determined by two corresponding partners on interdependent lattices, where the imitated neighbors are chosen in accordance with the average, maximum and minimum of reputation values between two partners within the neighborhood of a focal player. A large plethora of simulations indicate that three reputation computing rules all lead to the promotion of cooperation when compared to the traditional public goods game model. Among them, the promotion of cooperation under the average and minimum schemes are relatively better than that produced by the maximum rule. The detailed cluster formation and reputation distribution are provided to illustrate the slight difference between the outcomes under these three decision making criterions, in which the choice of learning objects is governed by their reputations. Thus, we can conclude that current results are further conducive to understanding the universal and persuasive cooperation within many natural, biological, social and even man-made systems.},

  abstract = {In the field of evolutionary game theory, network reciprocity has become an important means to promote the level of promotion within the population system. Recently, the interdependency provides a novel perspective to understand the widespread cooperation behavior in many real-world systems. In previous works, interdependency is often built from the direct or indirect connections between two networks through the one-to-one mapping mode. However, under many realistic scenarios, players may need much more information from many neighboring agents so as to make a more rational decision. Thus, beyond the one-to-one mapping mode, we investigate the cooperation behavior on two interdependent lattices, in which the utility evaluation of a focal player on one lattice may not only concern himself, but also integrate the payoff information of several corresponding players on the other lattice. Large quantities of simulations indicate that the cooperation can be substantially promoted when compared to the traditionally spatial lattices. The cluster formation and phase transition are also analyzed in order to explore the role of interdependent utility coupling in the collective cooperation. Current results are beneficial to deeply understand various mechanisms to foster the cooperation exhibited inside natural, social and engineering systems.},

If this assumption is false\textemdash or even if the quality of survey participants' responses change because of measurement\textemdash then social scientists risk mischaracterizing the existence, magnitude, and correlates of changes across survey waves in respondents' characteristics. In this article, we make the case that social scientists ought to worry more about panel conditioning biases. We also describe and demonstrate empirical strategies for estimating the magnitude of such biases in longitudinal surveys, and we provide illustrative empirical results that are germane to social science research. We end by outlining a research agenda that would generate specific information about the nature and degree of panel conditioning in specific longitudinal surveys as well as a broader understanding of the circumstances in which panel conditioning is most likely to occur.},

For example, the behavior of a pedestrian who wants to cross the street depends on whether or not he believes that the driver of an oncoming car has seen him or not. People can also reason about the theory of mind abilities of others, leading to recursive thinking of the sort `I think that you think that I think\ldots '. Previous research suggests that this ability may be especially effective in simple competitive settings. In this paper, we use a combination of computational agents and Bayesian model selection to determine to what extent people make use of higher-order theory of mind reasoning in a particular competitive game known as matching pennies. We find that while many children and adults appear to make use of theory of mind, participants are also often classified as using a simpler reactive strategy based only on the actions of the directly preceding round. This may indicate that human reasoners do not primarily use their theory of mind abilities to compete with others.},

The intrinsic heterogeneity of individuals' capability and willingness makes significant impact on the promotion of cooperation rate. In this paper, we propose a two-phase Heterogeneous Public Goods Game (HPGG) model to study the cooperation dynamics in CSNs. We introduce two factors to represent the heterogeneity of individual behaviors and the benefit-to-cost enhancement of population, respectively. Based on HPGG CSN model, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between cooperation rate and individuals' heterogeneous behaviors from an evolutionary game perspective. Simulations on the population structure of scale-free networks show the evolution of cooperation in CSNs has no-trivial dependence on the individuals' heterogeneous behaviors. Compared with standard PGG and single-phase heterogeneous PGG, HPGG provides a more precise mechanism to promote cooperation rate of CSNs. Finally, data traces collected from real experiments also demonstrate the preciseness of HPGG in formulating the cooperation dynamics on CSNs. \textcopyright{} 1983-2012 IEEE.},

Attitudes and perceptions concerning the trustworthiness of governmental institutions receiving test-taker data have been explored, with varied findings, but no robust models or deterministic relationships have been established that account for these differences. These results also do not explore in detail the perceptions regarding other types of organizations e.g., private corporations. Further, considerations of privacy interdependence arising from blood relative relationships have been absent from the conversation regarding the sharing of genetic data. This paper reports the results from a factorial vignette survey study in which we investigate how variables of ethnicity, age, genetic markers, and association of data with the individual's name affect the likelihood of sharing data with different types of organizations. We also investigate elements of personal and interdependent privacy concerns. We document the significant role these factors have in the decision to share or not share genetic data. We support our findings with a series of regression analyses. \textcopyright{} 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Various reasons for non-disclosure of personal details or identity falsification were considered, such as the desire to remain anonymous. To this end, a user study was carried out among 169 students of the Israeli academia, via a quantitative method using closed-ended questionnaires. The desire to remain anonymous was found as the most prevalent reason for this behavior and was always ranked as one of the top reasons among every subpopulation that was examined (e.g. men / women, Bachelor / Master students, etc.). In addition, we made an attempt to predict the tendency of non-disclosure of personal details or identity falsification upon website registration, by using a multiple logistic regression taking into account various privacy and anonymity related reasons, such as anonymity awareness and privacy concern. However, it was found insignificant for the factors examined. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 by the International Institute ofInformatics and Systemics.},

Existing studies on this topic have often relied on artificial settings and highly specialized research contexts, leading to context-specific results. Contrary, data-selling platforms can serve as a natural context to investigate users' willingness-to-sell (i.e., valuation of) personal information. We conducted a two-step study among 299 Internet users including a qualitative study and a choice-based conjoint analysis to investigate the antecedents of users' willingness-to-sell information on data-selling platforms and their relative importances.

  abstract = {Collaborative networks and data sharing initiatives are broadening the opportunities for the advancement of science. These initiatives offer greater transparency in science, with the opportunity for external research groups to reproduce, replicate, and extend research findings. Further, larger datasets offer the opportunity to identify homogeneous patterns within subgroups of individuals, where these patterns may be obscured by the heterogeneity of the neurobiological measure in smaller samples. However, data sharing and data pooling initiatives are not without their challenges, especially with new laws that may at first glance appear quite restrictive for open science initiatives. Interestingly, what is key to some of these new laws (i.e, the European Union's general data protection regulation) is that they provide greater control of data to those who ``give'' their data for research purposes. Thus, the most important element in data sharing is allowing the participants to make informed decisions about how they want their data to be used, and, within the law of the specific country, to follow the participants' wishes. This framework encompasses obtaining thorough informed consent and allowing the participant to determine the extent that they want their data shared, many of the ethical and legal obstacles are reduced to just monsters under the bed. In this manuscript we discuss the many options and obstacles for data sharing, from fully open, to federated learning, to fully closed. Importantly, we highlight the intersection of data sharing, privacy, and data ownership and highlight specific examples that we believe are informative to the neuroimaging community.},

  abstract = {In recent years \textendash{} and especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic \textendash{} online shopping has become a part of everyday life for many people. Yet, in contrast to buying at a traditional retail store, staying anonymous is at least difficult if not impossible when shopping online \textendash{} in particular, when physical goods are to be delivered. From the customer perspective, reasons for seeking anonymity when shopping online can be manifold, for example some do not want anyone to know about their purchases, others do not want their data to be used by Big Data-enabled online retailers. From the point of view of online retailers, the prospect of anonymous online shopping should therefore not only be seen as a threat to their data-driven business models, but also as an opportunity to attract new customers.   In this thesis we search and find support in the literature regarding the question whether there is indeed a demand for anonymous online shopping, and we discuss system architecture designs that were proposed by other authors for potentially realizing what we call All-Steps Anonymous Purchase Platforms (ASAPP). We propose a new architecture design that improves earlier work by realizing the concept of Separation of Data within a single platform: GhostBuy.  We implement a working prototype of this platform that demonstrates not only the fundamental feasibility of the architecture but also that such a platform can be realized with a look-and-feel similar to that of common online shops. We also propose solutions for certain related aspects that are particularly important in the context of such a platform, as for example a guaranteed use of secure user passwords or application-level database encryption.   We evaluate to what extent the proposed architecture and prototype preserve the customers' anonymity/privacy, showing that the prototype provides it to the maximum possible extent that can be achieved based on the proposed architecture. We also show that the system provides 256-bit security against all but one considered cryptographic and mis-authentication attack vectors and discuss how this can also be achieved for the remaining attack vector. Closing our evaluation, we show how well the platform could presumably be deployed in the real world. Finally, limitations, possible improvements, and potential further future work are discussed and proposed.},

In this article I argue that judgements are best aggregated by merging the evidence on which they are based, rather than by directly merging the judgements themselves. This leads to a three-step strategy for judgement aggregation. First, merge the evidence bases of the various agents using some method of belief merging. Second, determine which degrees of belief one should adopt on the basis of this merged evidence base, by applying objective Bayesian theory. Third, determine which judgements are appropriate given these degrees of belief by applying a decision-theoretic account of rational judgement formation.},

Where the one-shot cheap-talk literature documents substantial overcommunication and preferences for honesty, the outcomes in our repeated setting are more consistent with uninformative babbling outcomes. This is particularly surprising, as honest revelation is supportable as an equilibrium outcome in our repeated setting. We show that inefficient outcomes are driven by a coordination failure on how to distribute the gains from information sharing. However, when agents can coordinate on the payment of an "information rent," honest revelation emerges.},

  abstract = {Background: The language of ``participant-driven research,'' ``crowdsourcing'' and ``citizen science'' is increasingly being used to encourage the public to become involved in research ventures as both subjects and scientists. Originally, these labels were invoked by volunteer research efforts propelled by amateurs outside of traditional research institutions and aimed at appealing to those looking for more ``democratic,'' ``patient-centric,'' or ``lay'' alternatives to the professional science establishment. As mainstream translational biomedical research requires increasingly larger participant pools, however, corporate, academic and governmental research programs are embracing this populist rhetoric to encourage wider public participation. Discussion: We examine the ethical and social implications of this recruitment strategy. We begin by surveying examples of ``citizen science'' outside of biomedicine, as paradigmatic of the aspirations this democratizing rhetoric was originally meant to embody. Next, we discuss the ways these aspirations become articulated in the biomedical context, with a view to drawing out the multiple and potentially conflicting meanings of ``public engagement'' when citizens are also the subjects of the science. We then illustrate two uses of public engagement rhetoric to gain public support for national biomedical research efforts: its post-hoc use in the ``care.data'' project of the National Health Service in England, and its proactive uses in the ``Precision Medicine Initiative'' of the United States White House. These examples will serve as the basis for a normative analysis, discussing the potential ethical and social ramifications of this rhetoric. Summary: We pay particular attention to the implications of government strategies that cultivate the idea that members of the public have a civic duty to participate in government-sponsored research initiatives. We argue that such initiatives should draw from policy frameworks that support normative analysis of the role of citizenry. And, we conclude it is imperative to make visible and clear the full spectrum of meanings of ``citizen science,'' the contexts in which it is used, and its demands with respect to participation, engagement, and governance.},

Thus, this paper analyses the effects of psychological factors on mobile consumer behaviour. Drawing on multiple established theories, four psychological factors are identified: (1) smartphone self-efficacy, (2) mobile-specific innovativeness, (3) mobile users' information privacy concerns, and (4) personal attachment to smartphone. Using a structural equation modeling approach with a large-scale consumer sample, the effects of these factors on two fundamental types of mobile consumer behaviour are analysed: behaviour along the mobile customer journey and consumers' willingness to disclose personal data in return for personalized mobile experiences. The results confirm the relevance of the identified factors for mobile consumer behaviour. These findings have several implications for the design and management of mobile touch points in tourism.},

Most social network platforms provide basic privacy protection mechanisms for users, allowing them to complete privacy settings according to their needs.

  abstract = {Understanding large-scale cooperation among unrelated individuals is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Since human cooperation evolves on social networks, the theoretical framework of multilayer networks is perfectly suited for studying this fascinating aspect of our biology. To that effect, we here study the cooperation in evolutionary games on interdependent networks, such that players in one network layer play the snowdrift game (SDG), and the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) in the other layer. Importantly, players are able to share information across two layers, which in turn affects their strategy choices. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the transfer of information about the strategy of the corresponding player in the other network layer alone is enough to significantly promote the overall level of cooperation. However, while the cooperation is markedly enhanced in the layer where the PDG is played, the opposite is true, albeit to a lesser extent, for the layer where the SDG is played. The net increase in cooperation is thus due to a doubly effect of information sharing. We show further that the more complete the information transfer, the more the overall level of cooperation is promoted, and that this holds as long as the information channels between the player do not vary over time. We discuss potential implications of these findings for future human experiments concerning the cooperation on multilayer networks.},

We put forward an improved traveler's dilemma game model on two coupled lattices to investigate the effect of coupling effect on the evolution of cooperation based on the traveler's dilemma game, where the coupling effect between two lattices is added into the strategy imitation process. Large quantities of simulations indicate that the cooperation behavior can be greatly varied when compared to those obtained on the traditionally single lattices. When the model parameter R surpasses a specific threshold, the cooperation will be greatly enhanced, but the cooperation may be inhibited if R is smaller than this threshold. Meanwhile, we also explore the relationship between the critical value Rc leading to the extinction of cooperation and the strategy range parameter radius in our model.

  abstract = {In the research realm of game theory, interdependent networks have extended the content of spatial reciprocity, which needs the suitable coupling between networks. However, thus far, the vast majority of existing works just assume that the coupling strength between networks is symmetric. This hypothesis, to some extent, seems inconsistent with the ubiquitous observation of heterogeneity. Here, we study how the heterogeneous coupling strength, which characterizes the interdependency of utility between corresponding players of both networks, affects the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game with two types of coupling schemes (symmetric and asymmetric ones). Compared with the traditional case, we show that heterogeneous coupling greatly promotes the collective cooperation. The symmetric scheme seems much better than the asymmetric case. Moreover, the role of varying amplitude of coupling strength is also studied on these two interdependent ways. Current findings are helpful for us to understand the evolution of cooperation within many real-world systems, in particular for the interconnected and interrelated systems.},

A multidisciplinary review is given in this paper, attempting to keep track of the historical development of the field and to shed light on its future directions. In the review, the authors discuss the disciplinary origins of opinion dynamics, showing that the combination of the social processes, which are conventionally studied in social sciences, and the analytical and computational tools, which are developed in mathematics, physics and complex system studies, gives birth to the interdisciplinary field of opinion dynamics. The current state of the art of opinion dynamics is then overviewed, with the research progresses on the typical models like the voter model, the Sznajd model, the culture dissemination model, and the bounded confidence model being highlighted. Correspondingly, the future directions of this academic field are envisioned, with an advocation for closer synthesis of the related disciplines.},

Blockchain 2.0 with smart contract has the natural advantage of being able to enable trust and automated transactions between a large number of users. This paper proposes a data sharing incentive model based on evolutionary game theory using blockchain with smart contract.

MARL corresponds to the learning problem in a multi-agent system in which multiple agents learn simultaneously. It is an interdisciplinary domain with a long history that includes game theory, machine learning, stochastic control, psychology, and optimisation. Although MARL has achieved considerable empirical success in solving real-world games, there is a lack of a self-contained overview in the literature that elaborates the game theoretical foundations of modern MARL methods and summarises the recent advances. In fact, the majority of existing surveys are outdated and do not fully cover the recent developments since 2010. In this work, we provide a monograph on MARL that covers both the fundamentals and the latest developments in the research frontier. The goal of our monograph is to provide a self-contained assessment of the current state-of-the-art MARL techniques from a game theoretical perspective. We expect this work to serve as a stepping stone for both new researchers who are about to enter this fast-growing domain and existing domain experts who want to obtain a panoramic view and identify new directions based on recent advances.},

In this study, we identified within-group neural synchronization in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) as a candidate mechanism underlying intergroup hostility. We organized 546 individuals into 91 three-versus-three-person intergroup competitions, induced in-group bonding or no-bonding control manipulation and measured neural activity and within-group synchronization using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. After in-group bonding (versus control), individuals gave more money to in-group members than to out-group members and contributed more money to outcompete their rivals. In-group bonding decreased rDLPFC activity and increased functional connectivity between the rDLPFC and the rTPJ. Especially during the out-group attack, in-group bonding also increased within-group synchronization in both the rDLPFC and the rTPJ, and within-group rDLPFC synchronization positively correlated with intergroup hostility. Within-group synchronized reduction in prefrontal activity might explain how in-group bonding leads to impulsive and collective hostility toward outsiders. \textcopyright{} 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

Several research studies have shown that power consumption patterns can reveal a range of information about consumers, such as how many people are in the home, the types of appliances they use, their eating and sleeping routines, and even the TV programs they watch. As we move toward liberalized energy markets, many different parties are interested in gaining access to such data, which has enormous economical, societal, and environmental benefits. However, the main concern is that many such beneficial uses of smart meter big data would be severely curtailed if the data were excessively protected due to individuals' privacy. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic mechanism that balances between beneficial uses of data and individuals' privacy in deregulated smart grids. Our mechanism solves the problem of access control by fairly compensating consumers for their participation in the data market based on the concept of differential privacy. The results of our experiments show the importance of taking consumers' attitudes toward privacy as a crucial element in designing balanced markets for fair data sharing. Furthermore, the experiments provide a principled way to choose reasonable values for privacy levels that are more relevant to real-world scenarios. \textcopyright{} 2015 IEEE.},

We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a "valid" or "maxent-normal" approximation. We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the "Bethe method", the "junction graph method", the "cluster variation method", and the "region graph method". Finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform BP.},

  abstract = {This study critically examines how online retailers aim to differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent customers by using digitally accessible data. Utilising social constructionism and actor-network theory as a theoretical framework, the study argues that online fraud is constructed through social practices as well as technological and organisational relations. This ongoing process involves several human and non-human actors embedded in heterogeneous networks, but the process is not neutral, and neither can the data used as the basis of fraud management be considered value-free. Big data has often been challenged as a neutral representation of reality, given that the collection and analysis thereof involve human biases, choices, selections and preferences. Consequently, the categories of risk assessment and manual fraud management practices represent these values.  However, from a manual fraud review perspective, automated fraud management systems gain an object-like status and often remain unchallenged, and the choices and selections behind these implementations go unnoticed. Categorisations and fraud scorings are pre-giving when manual reviewers enter the risk assessment process and can only operate within existing norms and structures. Manual reviewers take a similar approach and make decisions using additional data sources such as Google and personal and professional websites while imposing their own preferences, biases and understandings, or accepting, rejecting or negotiating alternative realities proposed by other reviewers. It is also crucial how manual reviewers are able to enrol and mobilise other actors to take action in line with their own interests.   The study shows that fraud assessment approaches create their own sense of normality and label those as suspicious or fraudulent who seem to deviate from the norm, thereby leading to the inclusion and exclusion of people. Furthermore, most fraud cases are not reported, which means that the vast majority remain unknown to the police, who then construct their own version of the crime.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a model of `theory of mind', namely, how we represent the intentions and goals of others to optimise our mutual interactions. We draw on ideas from optimum control and game theory to provide a `game theory of mind'. First, we consider the representations of goals in terms of value functions that are prescribed by utility or rewards. Critically, the joint value functions and ensuing behaviour are optimised recursively, under the assumption that I represent your value function, your representation of mine, your representation of my representation of yours, and so on ad infinitum. However, if we assume that the degree of recursion is bounded, then players need to estimate the opponent's degree of recursion (i.e., sophistication) to respond optimally. This induces a problem of inferring the opponent's sophistication, given behavioural exchanges. We show it is possible to deduce whether players make inferences about each other and quantify their sophistication on the basis of choices in sequential games. This rests on comparing generative models of choices with, and without, inference. Model comparison is demonstrated using simulated and real data from a `stag-hunt'. Finally, we note that exactly the same sophisticated behaviour can be achieved by optimising the utility function itself (through prosocial utility), producing unsophisticated but apparently altruistic agents. This may be relevant ethologically in hierarchal game theory and coevolution.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a model of `theory of mind', namely, how we represent the intentions and goals of others to optimise our mutual interactions. We draw on ideas from optimum control and game theory to provide a `game theory of mind'. First, we consider the representations of goals in terms of value functions that are prescribed by utility or rewards. Critically, the joint value functions and ensuing behaviour are optimised recursively, under the assumption that I represent your value function, your representation of mine, your representation of my representation of yours, and so on ad infinitum. However, if we assume that the degree of recursion is bounded, then players need to estimate the opponent's degree of recursion (i.e., sophistication) to respond optimally. This induces a problem of inferring the opponent's sophistication, given behavioural exchanges. We show it is possible to deduce whether players make inferences about each other and quantify their sophistication on the basis of choices in sequential games. This rests on comparing generative models of choices with, and without, inference. Model comparison is demonstrated using simulated and real data from a `stag-hunt'. Finally, we note that exactly the same sophisticated behaviour can be achieved by optimising the utility function itself (through prosocial utility), producing unsophisticated but apparently altruistic agents. This may be relevant ethologically in hierarchal game theory and coevolution.},

  abstract = {The privacy paradox describes people's willingness to disclose personal information on social network sites despite expressing high levels of concern. In this study, we employ the distinction between institutional and social privacy to examine this phenomenon. We investigate what strategies undergraduate students have developed, and their motivations for using specific strategies. We employed a mixed-methods approach that included 77 surveys and 21 in-depth interviews. The results suggest that, in addition to using the default privacy settings, students have developed a number of strategies to address their privacy needs. These strategies are used primarily to guard against social privacy threats and consist of excluding contact information, using the limited profile option, untagging and removing photographs, and limiting Friendship requests from strangers. Privacy strategies are geared toward managing the Facebook profile, which we argue functions as a front stage. This active profile management allows users to negotiate the need for connecting on Facebook with the desire for increased privacy. Thus, users disclose information, because they have made a conscious effort to protect themselves against potential violations. We conclude that there is a tilt toward social privacy concerns. Little concern was raised about institutional privacy and no strategies were in place to protect against threats from the use of personal data by institutions. This is relevant for policy discussions, because it suggests that the collection, aggregation, and utilization of personal data for targeted advertisement have become an accepted social norm.},

Understanding how agents can achieve cooperation in social dilemmas through learning from local experience is a critical problem that has motivated researchers for decades. This paper investigates the possibility of exploiting emotions in agent learning in order to facilitate the emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas. In particular, the spatial version of social dilemmas is considered to study the impact of local interactions on the emergence of cooperation in the whole system. A double-layered emotional multiagent reinforcement learning framework is proposed to endow agents with internal cognitive and emotional capabilities that can drive these agents to learn cooperative behaviors. Experimental results reveal that various network topologies and agent heterogeneities have significant impacts on agent learning behaviors in the proposed framework, and under certain circumstances, high levels of cooperation can be achieved among the agents.},

By applying meta-analyses and SEM on 104 independent studies with 42,256 samples from existing empirical studies, we attempt to systematically reveal the relationship between privacy cognition and information disclosure. The results show that perceived privacy risks can significantly reduce personal information disclosure intention, as well as actual information disclosure behavior. However, privacy concerns only affect disclosure intention, but do not have a significant effect on actual information disclosure behavior. The study also verified that platform types have moderating effects on the privacy decision making of Internet users.

However, researchers are not well informed about the shift of PIP research trends with time. In particular, there is a lack of understanding of what constructs have been studied in what contexts. As a result, researchers may design their study without sufficient guidance. This problem can lead to unproductive efforts in advancing PIP research. Therefore, it is important and timely to review prior PIP research to enhance our understanding of how it has evolved. We are particularly interested in understanding the chronological changes in contexts and research constructs studied. We use a chronological stage model of PIP research we develop, a set of contextual variables identified from prior literature, and the four-party PIP model suggested by Conger et al. (2013) as theoretical foundations to conduct a chronological literature review of empirical PIP concern studies. We find several PIP research trends during the last two decades, such as the quantity of PIP research has drastically increased; the variety of contexts and research constructs being studied has increased substantially; and many constructs have been studied only once while only a few have been repeatedly studied. We also find that the focus of PIP research has shifted from general/unspecified contexts to specific ones. We discuss the contributions of the study and recommendations for future research directions. We propose a fifth party as an emergent player in the ecosystem of PIP and call for future research that investigates it.},

The objective of this work is to investigate the role of individual scientists and their collaborations in enhancing the knowledge flows, and consequently the scientific production. The methodology involves two main phases. First, the data on all the nanotechnology journal publications in Canada was extracted from the SCOPUS database to create the co-authorship network, and then employ statistical data mining techniques to analyze the scientists' research performance and partnership history. Also, a questionnaire was sent directly to the researchers selected from our database seeking the predominant properties that make a scientist sufficiently attractive to be selected as a research partner. In the second phase, an agent-based model using Netlogo has been developed to study the network in its dynamic context where several factors could be controlled. It was found that scientists in centralized positions in such networks have a considerable positive impact on the knowledge flows, while loyalty and strong connections within a dense local research group negatively affect the knowledge transmission. Star scientists appear to play a substitutive role in the network and are selected when the usual collaborators, i.e., most famous, and trustable partners are scarce or missing.},

SMQ satisfies interim incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget feasibility. Moreover, it uses purchased privacy expectation maximisation as a principle to produce accurate outputs for commonly-used queries such as counting, median and linear predictor.

Using the Big Five and HEXACO (Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience) personality frameworks, we review the role of personality in two main classes of economic games: social dilemmas and bargaining games. This reveals an emerging role for Big Five agreeableness in promoting cooperative, egalitarian, and altruistic behaviors across several games, consistent with its core characteristic of maintaining harmonious interpersonal relations. The role for extraversion is less clear, which may reflect the divergent effects of its underlying agentic and affiliative motivational components. In addition, HEXACO honesty-humility and agreeableness may capture distinct aspects of prosocial behavior outside the bounds of the Five-Factor Model. Important considerations and directions for future studies are discussed within the emerging personality-economics interface.},

This effect has been found in a wide range of tasks, raising the question of whether there is any `special' domain in which it is not found. One plausible candidate is face perception, which has sometimes been thought to be `special'. To test this possibility, we assessed participants' insight into their own face perception abilities (self-estimates) and those of other people (peer estimates). We found classic Dunning\textendash Kruger Effects in matching tasks for unfamiliar identity, familiar identity, gaze direction, and emotional expression. Low performers overestimated themselves, and high performers underestimated themselves. Interestingly, participants' self-estimates were more stable across tasks than their actual performance. In addition, peer estimates revealed a consistent egocentric bias. High performers attributed higher accuracy to other people than did low performers. We conclude that metacognitive insight into face perception abilities is limited and subject to systematic biases. Our findings urge caution when interpreting self-report measures of face perception ability. They also reveal a fundamental source of uncertainty in social interactions.},

Traditional technical and organizational approaches used to address privacy issues ignore economic factors, which are increasingly important in the investment strategy of those responsible for ensuring privacy protection. Taking the mHealth system as the context, this article builds an evolutionary game to model three types of entities (including system providers, hospitals and governments) under the conditions of incomplete information and bounded rationality. Given that the various participating entities are often unable to accurately estimate their own profits or costs, we propose a quantified approach to analyzing the optimal strategy of privacy investment and regulation. Numerical examples are provided for illustration and simulation purpose. Based upon these examples, several countermeasures and suggestions for privacy protection are proposed. Our analytical results show that governmental regulation and auditing has a significant impact on the strategic choice of the other two entities involved. In addition, the strategic choices of system providers and hospitals are not only correlated with profits and investment costs, but they are also significantly affected by free riding. If the profit growth coefficients increase to a critical level, mHealth system providers and hospitals will invest in privacy protection even without the imposition of regulations. However, the critical level is dependent on the values of the parameters (variables) in each case of investment and profits.},

These smart contracts, running on the Ethereum blockchain, implement access control lists and grant immutability, traceability and verifiability of the references to personal data, which is stored itself in a (possibly distributed) file system. A distributed authorization mechanism is devised, where trust from multiple network nodes is necessary to grant the access to the data. To this aim, two possible alternatives are described: a Secret Sharing scheme and Threshold Proxy Re-Encryption scheme. The performance of these alternatives is experimentally compared in terms of execution time. Threshold Proxy Re-Encryption appears to be faster in different scenarios, in particular when increasing message size, number of nodes and the threshold value, i.e. number of nodes needed to grant the data disclosure.},

  abstract = {Despite increasing studies of information technology (IT) monitoring, our understanding of how IT-mediates relations between the watcher and watched remains limited in two areas. First, either traditional actor-centric frameworks assuming predefined watcher-watched relationships (e.g., panopticon or synopticon) are adopted or monitoring actors are removed to focus on data flows (e.g., dataveillance, assemblages, panspectron). Second, IT monitoring research predominantly assumes IT artifacts to be stable, bounded, designed objects, with prescribed uses which provides an oversimplified view of actor relationships. To redress these limitations, a conceptual framework of veillance applicable to a variety of possible IT or non-IT-mediated relationships between watcher and watched is developed. Using the framework, we conduct a conceptual review of the literature, identifying IT-enabled monitoring and transformations of actors, goals, mechanisms and foci and develop an action net model of IT veillance where IT artifacts are theorized as equivocal, distributable and open for diverse use, open to edits and contributions by unbounded sets of heterogenous actors characterized by diverse goals and capabilities. The action net of IT veillance is defined as a flexible decentralized interconnected web shaped by multidirectional watcher-watched relationships, enabling multiple dynamic goals and foci. Cumulative contributions by heterogenous participants organize and manipulate the net, having an impact through influencing dispositions, visibilities and the inclusion/exclusion of self and others. The model makes three important theoretical contributions to our understanding of IT monitoring of watchers and watched and their relationships. We discuss implications and avenues for future studies on IT veillance.},

  author = {Zurbirggen, Gina},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Over the past 10 years, numerous scandals involving personal data shocked the world. In 2013, the whistle blower Edward Snowden came forward and disclosed various worldwide government surveillance programs (Jill Lepore, 2019). In 2018 the Cambridge Analytica scandal erupted, revealing that the so-called behavior changing agency had without consent harvested the personal data of millions of people's Facebook profiles and used it for political advertising purposes (Steve Andriole, 2019). In early 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Council released an alarming report, that revealed that 10 dating apps, among them Tinder and Grindr, had collected and sold sensitive consumer data to over 135 companies. The data includes information about sexual orientation, political beliefs and drug usage (City Am, 2020). Those and other distressing revelations made consumers worldwide more aware of the value and misusage of their personal data. Despite the newfound awareness, consumers make little to no change to their online behavior and keep using applications that have been proven to invade their privacy. This inconstancy between the consumer privacy concerns and their behavior online is known as Digital Privacy Paradox (Spyros Kokolakis, 2015). The Rational Choice Theory is suggesting that individuals make reasonable and logical decisions in order to create the greatest benefit or satisfaction (Susanne Barth, Menno D.T. de Jong 2017). However, to explain the paradoxical online consumer behavior solely with this theory is over simplified, insufficient and does not lead to a substantially better understanding. The Rational Choice Approach is lacking in the necessary incorporation of emotional and of behavioral aspects. Online and offline, many actions are driven by irrational affective factors. This irrational online behavior is caused by faulty estimation of risks and potential threats. Consumer risk assessment is strongly influenced by benefit and emotional biases (Christoph Lutz, PePe Strathoff, 2014). Even though, there has been extensive research to proof the existents of the Digital Privacy Paradox, it is a complex phenomenon and a very current subject that requires further research. The aim of this work is to gain an improved understanding of the complex paradox by gathering existing information and by conducting a survey experiment. Further, to offer solutions on how tech giants and social media companies can address the privacy concerns of consumers and (re)built trust, while keep being able to personalize their products and gain valuable marketing insides.
